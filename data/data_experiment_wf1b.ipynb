    "[1  ,0,0,\"Despite the abundant renewable energy sources, the Iranian energy sector relies almost entirely on fossil fuel energy resources. Power sector is dominant source of CO2 emissions and responsible for about 35% of total CO2 emissions in the country. Additionally, long-term electricity demand of Iran is expected to grow quickly, which in turn requires extensive investment to meet the growing demand over the next decades. On the other hand, increasing domestic fossil fuel consumption had been a serious challenge due to high costs of oil and gas. Current study pays particular attention to the possible penetration rates of renewable electricity technologies and their implications for fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The analysis is performed by using an energy supply optimization model. Different scenarios are defined to evaluate the impact of fossil fuel prices and carbon tax on utilization of renewable resources.\"],\n",

    "[4  ,0,0,\"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the recent global issues where the negative influence and effect on the environment is high. Enhancing the degree of awareness among public and concerned authorities and developing forecasting methods and techniques form a vital solution to this issue. The aim of this research is to enhance the forecasting efficiency of the traditional GM(1,N) model by proposing and modifying background values of GM(1,N) using a new algorithms. This paper presents the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to select the optimal weight of background values for a traditional GM(1,N) model. The data of CO2 emissions, GDP per capita, the amount invested in Malaysia, population, total energy consumption and number of registered motor vehicles during the period from 2000 to 2016 is used to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the model.

    "[5  ,0,0,\"We assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions over the two-year horizon 2020Q1-2021Q4. We apply a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model, which captures complex spatial-temporal interdependencies across countries associated with the international propagation of economic impact due to the virus spread. The model makes use of a unique quarterly data set of coal, natural gas, and oil consumption, output, exchange rates and equity prices, including global fossil fuel prices for 32 major CO2 emitting countries spanning the period 1984Q1–2019Q4. We produce forecasts of coal, natural gas and oil consumption, conditional on GDP growth scenarios based on alternative IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts that were made before and after the outbreak. We also simulate the effect of a relative price change in fossil fuels, due to global scale carbon pricing, on consumption and output. Our results predict fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to return to their pre-crisis levels, and even exceed them, within the two-year horizon despite the large reductions in the first quarter following the outbreak. Our forecasts anticipate more robust growth for emerging than for advanced economies. The model predicts recovery to the pre-crisis levels even if another wave of pandemic occurs within a year. Our counterfactual carbon pricing scenario indicates that an increase in coal prices is expected to have a smaller impact on GDP than on fossil fuel consumption. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic would not provide countries with a strong reason to delay climate change mitigation efforts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",
    "[6  ,0,0,\"This paper formulates flow of energy from primary resources and import routes to different socio-economic sectors by making use of Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model. It presents a baseline of how Iran’s future production and consumption patterns evolve. It also seeks plausible scenario for renewable energies utilization and evaluates its mitigation potential and economic aspects. Model results indicate that exploitation of a 'not-too-strict' package of renewable sources featuring 10 GW of wind and 19 GW of hydro by the end of 2035 will lead to CO2 emissions to be reduced up to an amount of 190.7 million tons in the study period. By accounting for the opportunity costs different fossil fuels can have, and with a 22% discount rate, abatement of 1 ton of CO2 costs about 7.5 $ (in 2005 constant prices) that declines to zero with a discount rate equal to 7.7%.

    "[7  ,0,0,\"This chapter estimates the interrelationships between growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in interaction with the consumption of fossil fuel and renewable energy consumption in a global context. In such a system the variable of renewable energy production capacity is introduced. It is found that growth in this variable has a significant effect on the growth of renewable energy consumption. This is the case for instantaneous unilateral regressions as well as for a vector error regression model. For the latter model the finding is that renewable capacity reduces fossil fuel use in the long run, while it also reduces economic growth. This suggests a difficult trade-off between applying renewables capacity for CO2 reductions, while also trying to maintain economic growth. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

    "[8  ,0,0,\"Forecasting energy consumption of economic activities is important for China to cope with climate change and maintain sustainable economic growth. This study proposes a novel temporal input-output approach that not only forecast the energy consumption of various economic sectors, but also reflects the spread process of inter-sectoral ripple effect of energy consumption from a temporal perspective. Using China's 2015 annual input-output table and data of nearly 3500 listed companies in China's A-share market, we plot the ripple time curves depicting actual energy consumption resulting from China's three main final demands, i.e., Investment, Export, and Consumption. The results show that the manufacturing sector, construction sector and electric power/thermal sector have critical impact on the China's energy consumption. Among all final demands, the Export demand and Investment demand are the main factors causing energy consumption. This study improves the input-output approach from the perspective of time in order to make timely and effective forecast for the China's energy consumption based on real-time data about final demands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[9  ,0,0,\"The Malaysian Government has been introducing fuel diversification policies over the past decade by considering other sources of fuel such as alternative and renewables into the electricity mix as a measure to lengthen the oil and gas reserves against premature depletion. Since electricity consumption forms about a fifth of the total energy consumption, and directly impacts the country's economy and people's well-being, it is necessary to pay emphasis on Malaysia's long-term power sector planning by identifying sustainable options which will enhance Malaysia's energy security and mitigate climate change. This paper presents an analysis of the long-term power generation options for Malaysia by deploying the integrated MARKAL-EFOM system (TIMES) model. The examined scenarios are business as usual (BAU) and optimized least cost scenarios which include: existing technology, plus renewable, plus nuclear as well as, plus photovoltaic (PV) and storage. The results indicated that Malaysia has sufficient renewable energy resources to meet the projected electricity demand by 2050 and fossil fuels can be fully replaced with electricity sourced from large hydropower and combination of other indigenous sustainable energy sources. The variability issue of renewables can be stabilized with the integration of storage systems into the grid. This analysis also demonstrated that installation of 8.57 GW solar PV panels on existing rooftops combined with 3.6 GW large-scale pumped heat energy storage (PHES) system can generate electricity comparable to a 2.0 GW nuclear plant at a lower system cost of $102.4 billion. Hence, if Malaysia were to adopt a sustainable policy, then nuclear power would not be an ideal option as uranium fuel relies on continuous imports. © 2017 The Authors.

    "[11 ,0,0,\"Implementation of the Kyoto commitments will result in lesser global fossil fuel consumption in 2010 than would occur in the absence of climate policy. The paper explores how the consumption change resulting from climate policy implementation could affect the producer prices of fossil fuels. The conclusion is that the price impact will be insignificant if the climate policy goals are established credibly and in the near future, for that will give rationally behaving fossil fuel producers ample time to adjust production capacity to the changed outlook for future demand. It is argued that as long as capacity develops in line with demand, prices should remain the same, irrespective of the speed and direction of demand change. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "[12 ,0,0,\"Crude oil, coal and gas are the main resources for world energy supply. The size of fossil fuel reserves and the dilemma that 'when non-renewable energy will be diminished' is a fundamental and doubtful question that needs to be answered. This paper presents a new formula for calculating when fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted and develops an econometrics model to demonstrate the relationship between fossil fuel reserves and some main variables. The new formula is modified from the Klass model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approximately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only fossil fuel remaining after 2042. In the Econometrics model, the main exogenous variables affecting oil, coal and gas reserve trends are their consumption and respective prices between 1980 and 2006. The models for oil and gas reserves unexpectedly show a positive and significant relationship with consumption, while presenting a negative and significant relationship with price. The econometrics model for coal reserves, however, expectedly illustrates a negative and significant relationship with consumption and a positive and significant relationship with price. Consequently, huge reserves of coal and low-level coal prices in comparison to oil and gas make coal one of the main energy substitutions for oil and gas in the future, under the assumption of coal as a clean energy source. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

    "[13 ,0,0,\"The Kyoto Protocol requires the U.S. to reduce the rate of emissions of six greenhouse gases (GHG) to 93% of their 1990 rate and to achieve this target by the 2008 to 2012 commitment period. This study assesses the magnitude of change needed in the U.S. economy and, specifically, in the U.S. energy sector, to achieve and maintain the target established by the Kyoto Protocol. A simple carbon (C) emissions-energy model is explained in this analysis using four key variables. Current and future trends in C emissions are explained by: the carbon/energy (C/E) ratio, Gross Domestic Product growth, energy prices and an energy trend variable. Potential GHG mitigation policy actions affect C emissions indirectly by affecting at least one of these key variables. The analysis concludes that reducing fossil energy use in the U.S. to meet the Kyoto GHG emissions reduction target would be very costly. Technological progress that reduces C emissions would not be fully sufficient without prematurely abandoning productive capital equipment. Energy price increases of about 14% per year, or declines in economic growth of almost 5% per year, could reduce energy demand and associated C emissions enough to achieve the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.\"],\n",

Here we look at what may be considered a lower bound for 21st century emissions given two assumptions: first, that extractable fossil-fuel resources follow the trends assumed by 'peak oil' adherents, and second, that no climate mitigation policies are put in place to limit emissions. If resources, and more importantly, extraction rates, of fossil fuels are more limited than posited in full energy-system models, a supply-driven emissions scenario results; however, we show that even in this 'peak fossil-fuel' limit, carbon emissions are high enough to surpass 550 ppm or 2 °C climate protection guardrails.

    "[19 ,0,0,\"The energy intensive nature of electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking necessitates that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will affect steelmakers directly and/or through electric power producers. A model of GHG emissions from an EAF meltshop has been developed using the life cycle assessment approach. Direct and indirect sources of GHG gas emissions are estimated and ranked. Furnace combustion optimisation was evaluated in case studies conducted on a Canadian conventional EAF and a British scrap preheating 'shaft' furnace. The analysis assumed 32 and 68% fossil fuel electricity generation, respectively. These case studies show that indirect GHG emission sources, in particular electricity generation, are more significant than direct emissions from the EAF. For the conventional EAF, offgas analysis and improved combustion control reduced electricity consumption by 40 kWh t-1, costs by US$1.05/t, and GHG emissions by 20 kg CO2-eq./t. For the shaft EAF, real time offgas monitoring and closed loop burner control reduced electricity consumption by 25 kWh t-1, costs by US$3.6/t, and GHG emissions by 15 kg CO2-eq./t. The case studies show that combustion optimisation using an EAF offgas analysis and combustion control system provides greater electricity, cost, and GHG reductions than previously reported in the literature.\"],\n",
    "[20 ,0,0,\"Energy consumption in the transport sector depends almost exclusively on fossil fuels-oil. The forecasts show a growing tendency of this sector in the following years. The price of oil on global markets continues to remain high. Peak oil production is predicted to start shortly or even that it has been already started (Narodoslawsky, 2007; Robelius, 2007; The Oil Drum). At the same time, a significant rise in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is raising the earth's temperature and is causing climate change (Hamilton, 2008). Therefore it is important to take actions towards energy efficiency, emissions reductions, fuel supply security, and low-carbon economy. Biomass is renewable only if production is sustainable. Also, different research studies have showed that lower carbon footprints are achieved by utilizing biomass, when compared to energy generated from fossil sources. On the other hand higher amounts of nitrogen are emitted into air and water (Cherubini and Strømman, 2011; Bauer, 2008; ?u?ek et al., 2011). This contribution focuses on the simultaneous integration of different technologies for converting starchy and lignocellulosic raw materials to bioethanol. Different paths are selected: biochemical, thermo-chemical and thermo-biochemical and integrated in one superstructure so that operating costs, energy and agricultural land are minimized and profit is maximized. The ethanol production is assumed to be centralized. Raw materials are assumed to grow on the agricultural area of the maximum of 50 000 hectares. The fossil energy used in the supply chain of bioethanol production is also calculated and analyzed. The degree of (un)sustainability of the bioethanol production system is evaluated by the carbon and nitrogen footprint and compared to gasoline supply chain. Multi-objective optimization is performed on bioethanol supply chain where net footprints are minimized. The optimization of the system is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The problem is solved by the use of the Mixed-Integer Process Synthesizer MIPSYN using mass and energy balances and other constraints with profit maximization as the optimization criterion. © 1st Annual World Congress on Sustainable Engineering 2011 - Topical Conference at the 2011 AIChE Annual Meeting.

    "[22 ,0,0,\"The major challenge facing society in the 21st century is to improve the quality of life for all citizens in an egalitarian way, by providing sufficient food, shelter, energy and other resources for a healthy meaningful life, whilst at the same time decarbonizing anthropogenic activity to provide a safe global climate. This means limiting the temperature rise to below 2°C. Currently, spreading wealth and health across the globe is dependent on growing the GDP of all countries. This is driven by the use of energy, which until recently has mostly derived from fossil fuel, though a number of countries have shown a decoupling of GDP growth and greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector through rapid increases in low carbon energy generation. Nevertheless, as low carbon energy technologies are implemented over the coming decades, fossil fuels will continue to have a vital role in providing energy to drive the global economy. Considering the current level of energy consumption and projected implementation rates of low carbon energy production, a considerable quantity of fossil fuels will still be used, and to avoid emissions of GHG, carbon capture and storage (CCS) on an industrial scale will be required. In addition, the IPCC estimate that large scale GHG removal from the atmosphere is required using technologies such as Bioenergy CCS to achieve climate safety. In this paper we estimate the amount of carbon dioxide that will have to be captured and stored, the storage volume and infrastructure required if we are to achieve both the energy consumption and GHG emission goals. By reference to the UK we conclude that the oil and gas production industry alone has the geological and engineering expertise and global reach to find the geological storage structures and build the facilities, pipelines and wells required. Here we consider why and how oil and gas companies will need to morph into hydrocarbon production and carbon dioxide storage enterprises, and thus be economically sustainable businesses in the long term, by diversifying in and developing this new industry.

    "[24 ,0,0,\"Higher and more volatile liquid fossil fuel prices have had profound effects on international energy and wood product markets.

    "[25 ,0,0,\"An increase in energy prices will reduce environmental emissions via two channels. This policy will decrease the fossil fuel consumption and hence will cause emission reduction. On the other hand, the cost-push will encourage technology improvement for firms and households. These changes in fossil fuel demand and energy use technology will affect the emission level. It is estimated that phasing out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020, will cut the expected growth in carbondioxide emissions by 2 gigatons. Herein, Iran stands in 10 th grade by annual CO2 emission in the world and 1 st in the MENA. Along with G-20 leaders commitment to 'rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption', Iran is also taking a key step toward reforming energy subsidies and increasing the prices. In early 2010, a law outlining far-reaching subsidy reform was enacted in Iran and is started by December 2010. The subsidy reform law calls for gradual implementation of market-based energy pricing and the replacement of subsidies by targeted assistance to lower income groups. Policy makers expect that phasing out energy subsidies in Iran will reduce annual emissions. The policy includes huge increase in energy prices. Electricity, gasoline, kerosene, natural gas, gasoil and crude oil prices are going to increase. However, as the relative prices are going to change extremely in this policy, the economic theory estimates a substitution between energies. This will result in an increased consumption of relatively cheaper energy goods. In other words, we expect that the changes of production and consumption technology towards more consumption of electricity and gasoline which face minimum increase in prices. As the emission factor differs for every pollutant for each energy good, it may increase emission of some pollutants. We may call this effect as 'reverse emission effect' of energy price increase policy. The reverse emission effect may reduce the benefits of energy price increase. Environmental economists suggest that energy taxes may improve environmental quality, stimulate technological innovation and enhance energy security. Also, the so called 'double dividend hypothesis' indicates that tax revenues from environmental or green taxes can be used to cut other taxes. While double dividend hypothesis talks about carbon taxes, the reverse emission effect is about relative energy prices (when the focus of the policy is not on carbon emission). With the existence of the reverse emission effect both revenues and environmental gains fall. The revenue of the policy of energy price increase depends on the levels of price increase and quantity demanded. The more the energy price increase, the more the revenues. Production sectors and households try to enlighten the cost shock by shifting towards cheaper energies. This shift declines the demand for more revenue-making energy goods while increases the demand for less revenuemaking ones. This results in a decline in the expected revenue of energy policy. On the other hand, the emission factor is variable among different energy goods. Hence, by shifting from one type of energy to another, it is expected that the composition of the pollutants' emission differs. In the present paper, the hypothesis of the existence of 'reverse emission effect' for the energy price policy in Iran is under investigation. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model consisted of 7 energy types (Electricity, natural gas, liquid gas, gasoline, kerosene, fuel, gasoil) and also 7 pollutants (CO, CO2, S02, S03, CH, SPM, NOx) was applied. The model is calibrated based on a 2001 Micro Consistent Matrix from the Ministry of Energy developed by the authors. The matrix also illustrates emission factors for Iranian production sectors and households. Emission factors differ across various sectors. They also differ across various energy types. We also assume different scenarios of energy layer elasticity which describe different technology changes in our sensitivity analysis. In the next section, we will introduce our model and the applied methodology. Then the results will be discussed. And the last section will be the conclusions. Materials and Methods To measure the 'reverse emission effect' a comprehensive computational framework is required. The pervasive role of energy in economy and the numerous ways in which energy subsidies can distort resource allocations imply the necessity of a general equilibrium approach. Within all the applied models, the mathematical properties of the general equilibrium model provide a rich and powerful foundation for many modern microeconomic theories and policy analyses. Although CGE modeling has many benefits, its complexity causes the necessity of more time for calibration and more effort for development. Prior to the 1980s, in many practical applications it was difficult to develop the data, formulate, and solve the equations required for general equilibrium. But today, advanced optimization algorithms and computer technology allow us to analyze a wide range of energy policies using the computable general equilibrium approach. There are many CGE exercises in modeling energy price reforms and evaluating the impacts of energy policies on specific issues. However, most of CGE exercises analyze the impact of the policy on the whole economy and environment. There are also a few CGE exercises concerning Iran. However, they rarely address the energy sector. One exception is the World Bank study on all kinds of reforms (including trade, tariff and non-tariff barriers and subsidies) in Iran. The World Bank study shows a decrease in fossil fuels wasteful consumption in Iran. However, it does not include the environmental effects and pollutants emissions. The Model Assumptions The current model includes 18 production sectors, rural and urban households, government, imports, and exports. Market clearance, income balance, and zero profit conditions for each sector are satisfied as the principals of any CGE model. Production is modeled by a series of nested CES production functions. There are four production categories in the present study: coal, crude oil and gas sectors; end-use energy sectors; energy intensive sectors. A set of nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions characterizes the use of inputs in the production of goods and services. Production exhibits constant returns to scale. Goods are produced with capital (K), labor (L), energy (E), and material (M) or briefly in KLEM structure. In other words, outputs in each sector are produced using aggregate non-energy intermediate goods, aggregate energy input, and primary inputs (labor and capital). The nested structure of the production and the aggregator functions are depicted by nested CES functions. A set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functions characterizes the differentiation of production among the production for domestic and export markets. Regarding imports, nested CES functions characterize the choice between imported and domestic varieties of the same good. In the labor market we assume perfect labor mobility between sectors which we expect to happen in the long run. It allows labor to move to the sectors which offer higher wages. We also expect wage flexibility in real terms. It means the nominal wages may decrease or increase less than general price levels. Iran has a managed foreign exchange market. However, ultimately the market forces are dominant. Hence, we model import and export forces in the foreign exchange market. As energy and oil has important roles in Iranian export, we expect fluctuations in foreign exchange after an energy price shock. Import increase is expected due to domestic price rise. Thus, the demand for foreign exchange increases. Also a fall in domestic energy consumption and hence increase in energy export is expected. However, due to the decrease in non-energy export, occurring a decline in the overall export is not obvious, due to the cost shock.\"],\n",
    "[26 ,0,0,\"US residential and commercial buildings were responsible for about 41 exajoules (EJ) of primary energy use per year in 2002, accounting for approximately 9% of the world fossil-fuel related anthropogenic carbon (C) emissions of 6.7 Gt that contribute to climate change. US Government-sponsored building energy efficiency research and implementation programs are focused on reducing energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings and reducing these carbon (C) emissions. Although not specifically intended for adaptation to a warmer climate and less effective than under today's cooler climate, these programs also could help reduce energy demand in a future warmer world. Warming scenarios projected by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 imply net overall decreases in both site energy and primary energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings, largely because of the reduced need for heating. However, there would be as much as a 25% increase in building space cooling demand and a significant part of the increase could be offset by energy-efficiency improvements in buildings. Overall, in the US, buildings-related energy efficiency programs would reduce site energy consumption in buildings in the US by more than 2 EJ in 2020 and primary energy by more than 3.5 EJ, more than enough to offset the projected growth in cooling energy consumption due to climate change and growth in the US building stock. The savings would have an estimated annual net value at 2005 energy prices of between $45.0 and $47.3 billion to consumers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"],\n",

    "[28 ,0,0,\"This paper examines the long-run relationship between energy demand, GNP and the real energy price in Japan using data covering 1887-2001. It is found that, if an Underlying Energy Demand Trend is appropriately incorporated, the resulting econometric model produces a long-run income elasticity of about unity and a long-run price elasticity of about-0.2. The estimated model is utilised to forecast energy consumption and CO2 emissions up to 2012. It is shown that given current economic conditions and policies there is considerable uncertainty about whether Japan will be able to meet its Kyoto target by reducing CO2 emissions in 2008-2012 to the 1990 level. It is shown that this uncertainty depends on the strength of the economy and leaves the Japanese government with a difficult policy dilemma. If there is a resurgence in growth to something near the annual average growth rate since the early 1980s a considerable effort will be required in order to meet its Kyoto target; requiring not only using the Kyoto Mechanisms, but also additional tougher domestic policies and measures such as emissions capping, R&amp;D incentives, and education for energy conservation in addition to a pricing and tax policy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

    "[29 ,0,0,\"Energy consumption in the transport sector depends almost exclusively on fossil fuels - oil. The forecasts show a growing tendency of this sector in the following years. The price of oil on global markets continues to remain high. Peak oil production is predicted to start shortly or even that it has been already started (Narodoslawsky, 2007; Robelius, 2007; The Oil Drum). At the same time, a significant rise in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is raising the earth's temperature and is causing climate change (Hamilton, 2008). Therefore it is important to take actions towards energy efficiency, emissions reductions, fuel supply security, and low-carbon economy. Biomass is renewable only if production is sustainable. Also, different research studies have showed that lower carbon footprints are achieved by utilizing biomass, when compared to energy generated from fossil sources. On the other hand higher amounts of nitrogen are emitted into air and water (Cherubini and Strømman, 2011; Bauer, 2008; •u•ek et al., 2011). This contribution focuses on the simultaneous integration of different technologies for converting starchy and lignocellulosic raw materials to bioethanol. Different paths are selected: biochemical, thermo-chemical and thermo-biochemical and integrated in one superstructure so that operating costs, energy and agricultural land are minimized and profit is maximized. The ethanol production is assumed to be centralized. Raw materials are assumed to grow on the agricultural area of the maximum of 50 000 hectares. The fossil energy used in the supply chain of bioethanol production is also calculated and analyzed. The degree of (un) sustainability of the bioethanol production system is evaluated by the carbon and nitrogen footprint and compared to gasoline supply chain. Multi-objective optimization is performed on bioethanol supply chain where net footprints are minimized. The optimization of the system is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The problem is solved by the use of the Mixed-Integer Process Synthesizer MIPSYN using mass and energy balances and other constraints with profit maximization as the optimization criterion.

    "[30 ,0,0,\"As fossil fuels reserves deplete rapidly and the low-carbon economy develops expeditiously, especially in China, natural gas as a clean and alternative energy is underway to help meet increased energy needs and climate needs. Therefore, accurate forecasts of natural gas production and consumption have been a necessary task for policy making in the coming years. This paper presents a review of natural gas forecasting models. The multicycle Hubbert model is employed to forecast China's annual nature gas production and to determine the peak production, the peak year and the future production trends based on several different URR scenarios. Moreover, a small-sample effective rolling GM(1,1) model is proposed for the first time to forecast exponential natural gas consumption with different lengths of data sets. Then, the grey relationship analysis is used to select the best consumption curve in correspond with different URR scenarios. The empirical result shows that the supply-demand gap will be larger and larger in the future, with a minimum gap of 22 bcm in 2011 and 225 bcm in 2050, with a maximum gap of 31 bcm in 2011 and 807 bcm in 2050, which indicates that the natural gas production in China cannot meet the rising consumption. Therefore, policy measures must be taken to ameliorate the situation, including expanding natural gas imports, increasing unconventional natural gas production, complementing the gap with other energy resources and combining energy saving with emission reduction. Accurate forecasting of natural gas production and consumption can provide the basis for decision making and help the government generate new significant policies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    "[31 ,0,0,\"As estimates for the amount of U.S. natural gas resources have grown, so have the prospects of rising U.S. natural gas exports. Projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been proposed-cumulatively accounting for about 12.5% of current U.S. natural gas production-and are at varying stages of regulatory approval. Projects require federal approval according to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. =717b) with the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission being the lead authorizing agencies. Pipeline exports, which accounted for 94% of all exports of U.S. produced natural gas in 2010, are also likely to rise. What effect exporting natural gas will have on U.S. prices is the central question in the debate of whether to export or not to export. A significant rise in U.S. natural gas exports would likely put upwards pressure on domestic prices, but the magnitude of any rise is currently unclear. There are numerous factors that will affect prices: export volumes, economic growth, differences in local markets, and governmen regulations, among others. With today's natural gas prices relatively low compared to global prices and historically low for the United States producers are looking for new markets for their natural gas. Producer contend that increased exports will not raise prices significantly as there is ample supply to meet domestic demand, and there will be the added benefits of increased revenues, trade, and jobs, and less flaring Consumers of natural gas, who are being helped by the low prices, feaprices will rise if natural gas is exported. Electric power generation represents potentially the greatest increase in natural gas consumption in the U.S. economy, primarily fo environmental reasons. Natural gas emits much less carbon dioxide and other pollutants than coal when combusted. Other types of consumption are not likely to increase natural gas demand domestically for a long time Use in the transportation sector to displace oil is likely to be smal because expensive new infrastructure and technologies would be required. There is discussion of a possible revival of the U.S petrochemicals sector, but the potential extent of a change is unclear. Getting natural gas to markets where it can be consumed, whethe domestically or internationally, is the industry's biggest challenge Infrastructure constraints, environmental regulations, and other factors wil influence how the market adjusts to balance supply and demand. Environmental groups are split regarding natural gas use, with some favoring increased use to curb emissions of certain pollutants, while others oppose expanded use of natural gas because it is not as clean a renewable forms of energy, such as wind or solar. The use of hydraulic fracturing to produce shale gas has also raised concerns among environmental groups particularly concerned with its possible impacts on water quality. The possibility of a significant increase in U.S. natural gas exportwill factor into ongoing debates on the economy, energy independence climate change, and energy security. As the proposed projects continue to develop, policymakers are likely to receive more inquiries about these projects. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.\"],\n",
    "[32 ,0,0,\"Energy portfolios are overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuel resources that perpetuate the consequences associated with climate change. Therefore, it is imperative to transition to more renewable alternatives to limit further harm to the environment. This study presents a univariate time series prediction model that evaluates sustainability outcomes of partial energy transitions. Future electricity generation at the state-level is predicted using exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The best prediction results are then used as an input for a sustainability assessment of a proposed transition by calculating carbon, water, land, and cost footprints. Missouri, USA was selected as a model testbed due to its dependence on coal. Of the time series methods, ARIMA exhibited the best performance and was used to predict annual electricity generation over a 10-year period. The proposed transition consisted of a one-percent annual decrease of coal’s portfolio share to be replaced with an equal share of solar and wind supply. The sustainability outcomes of the transition demonstrate decreases in carbon and water footprints but increases in land and cost footprints. Decision makers can use the results presented here to better inform strategic provisioning of critical resources in the context of proposed energy transitions. © 2020 by the authors.

    "[33 ,0,0,\"This paper explores some basic economics of the climate change issue and how government response may impact the petroleum industry. Possible economic aspects are addressed by examining past and projected fossil fuel production numbers, calculating their resulting emissions, and then projecting how regulations or taxes might affect energy prices and production. Nine medium to major petroleum companies, which do business in the USA, are currently factoring in some kind of carbon emission restrictions into their long-range business plans. A driver for these plans is that the vast majority of countries, including the world's largest CO2 emitters, have formally agreed to limit their CO2 emissions to avoid a 2°C (3.6°F) rise in global temperatures. Because there is no agreement yet on a set number of allowable emissions, this paper utilizes estimated carbon budgets from one paper, Meinshausen et al. (2009). Some pertinent results derived herein are the following: 1) oil and natural gas only comprise 33.3% of potential CO2 emissions from fossil fuels; 2) under a ?50% probability scenario of exceeding 2°C (3.6°F), all proven reserves of oil and natural gas (as of 2012) could be consumed, whereas only 56% could be utilized with continued coal consumption. To demonstrate how a market approach might limit carbon emissions, a simple model shows how an annually increasing carbon tax affects the relative price of fossil fuels and alternative energy. The objective of this paper is to present arguments that there are economic reasons for American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) to address the issue of climate change.

    "[34 ,0,0,\"To address the problem of climate change, G-20 government leaders committed to 'rationalize and phase-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage excessive consumption over the medium term', i.e., removing the perverse subsidies. Considering China's particular circumstances and the purposes of energy subsidies, the perverse fossil fuel subsidies in China mainly concentrated on industries, and gasoline, diesel and natural gas consumption, which are always regressive. Other subsidies, such as those for residential electricity consumption and agriculture, should be kept for the time being. Results indicate that China's perverse fossil fuel subsidies amounted to CNY 509.22 billion in 2008, equivalent to 61.2% of total fossil fuel subsidies and 1.69% of GDP in that year. In addition, reasonable subsidies will not affect energy conservation and emission reduction. Furthermore, CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our finding shows that removing perverse energy subsidies will result in a significant decline in energy demand and CO2 emissions, but will have negative impacts on the macro-economy. Therefore, supporting (or offsetting) policies, like carrying out other cost-benefit and sustainable programs with the revenues saved from subsidy reduction, are needed to alleviate the adverse impacts of removing perverse subsidies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[35 ,0,0,\"Energy consumption can be taken as one of crucial indicators for economic development in any regions. Rapid development of economic, population and urbanization in Anhui province of China has led energy consumption to grow rapidly. The considerable demand for energy has become an issue of great concern. For proper policy formulation, it is necessary to have reliable forecasts for energy consumption. However, energy consumption forecasting is affected by some potential factors, including historical energy consumption, economic activities, population and weather. These uncertain factors put forward higher requirements for energy consumption forecasting methods. Considering these problems, a reasonable feature selection method called stepwise regression is adopted to extract important variables before prediction. Historical energy consumption, average annual GDP growth rate, and total GDP are identified as key factors on annual energy consumption. Then, two probability density forecasting methods based on Box-Cox transformation quantile regression via normal distribution (N-BCQR) and gamma distribution(G-BCQR) are proposed to measure the uncertainty and estimate the future demand of energy in Anhui province of China. The comparatives results show that the N-BCQR outperforms G-BCQR and other existing methods in terms of point forecasts and interval predictions. In addition, on the strength of predefined assumptions regarding the average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, the energy consumption of Anhui province through 2023 is forecasted. The results indicate that total energy consumption of Anhui is an important component determining local economic growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[36 ,0,0,\"Thailand has established an ethanol program with a target of replacing all conventional gasoline with E10 gasohol (gasoline containing 10% by volume of ethanol) by 2012. This paper assesses the impacts of achieving the target on (1) land-use change, (2) trade balance, (3) gasoline and associated food crop self-sufficiency, and (4) GHG emissions. In addition, the abatement cost of replacing gasoline with gasohol (additional cost of supplying gasohol) and the tax revenue forgone in implementing the program are estimated. Finally, in order to obtain insights in relation to the prospects of the national program vs. project-based Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for CO2 abatement, the ethanol program is compared with specific biofuel projects. We find that achieving the ethanol program target can lead to a significant improvement in the gasoline self-sufficiency rate (from 10 to 20%) and significantly reduce GHG emissions (corresponding to 2% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2004) over the period of 2005-2012. The ethanol program can induce a significant (up to 200,000 ha in magnitude) transition from food crop production (mainly corn and rice) to cassava production for ethanol leading to a reduction in the self-sufficiency rates of associated food crops. But the crop self-sufficiency rates would still be above 100% and Thailand's agricultural sector should be able to accommodate the present program target. Whether and to what extent the program leads to an improvement in the trade balance depends substantially on fuel and agricultural prices, sources of cassava supply, and responses of refineries to decreased gasoline demand. The annual average gasoline substitution cost is estimated at 25-195 US$/tCO2e, which is high compared with the price of project-based certified emission reductions traded during 2006 but low compared with estimates of the cost of substituting biofuels for fossil fuels in Europe. The tax revenue forgone is estimated at 2-4 times the gasoline substitution cost. Thailand's ethanol program illustrates that under dynamic government support, it may not be possible to identify the additionality of CDM projects for biofuel production and blending with fossil fuels.

    "[37 ,0,0,\"Energy is a key input to human activities, development, and economic growth. Over the past two decades, energy has become the focus of international debate for two main reasons. First, energy use is the principal cause of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. The combustion of fossil fuel, which accounts for the vast majority of primary energy consumption, results in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which in turn represent the largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The second reason is the fact that most forms of energy used today are scarce resources, whose availability varies widely across geographic regions of the world. This aspect of resource availability drives discussions on how to provide access to energy to all people across the world and at what price.

The system cost discounted to 1985 at the rate of six percent per year was chosen as the objective function. The effects of carbon tax were also evaluated. In the high fuel price scenarios, carbon dioxide emissions are larger in 2010 than that in the low fuel price scenarios, because the consumption of coal, which is much cheaper than oil and natural gas is increased. On the contrary, emission is decreased in 2030 because the supply of steam coal is at the upper bound in every scenario, and nuclear and renewable energy are thus utilized more. In cases where a carbon tax is levied, annual carbon dioxide emissions decrease by up to about one half in 2030 compared with cases without carbon tax, though the system cost per GDP is almost the same. In this case, the nuclear and renewable energies are utilized at almost the maximum and then additional reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is only minimal even with the rise of fuel prices. © 1994, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

    "[41 ,0,0,\"Purpose – This paper aims to analyse Chinese policy instruments for climate change mitigation. Design/methodology/approach – First, the paper reviews Chinese energy consumption per unit of GDP (EC/GDP) in order to determine the overall effects of the combined policy instruments. Second, the different policy instruments are compared in terms of their effects. Third, the actual trends of EC/GDP in two provinces and the instruments adopted by them are analysed on the provincial level. Findings – The decline in EC/GDP can indirectly reflect the Chinese contribution to mitigation of CO2 emissions since fossil fuels dominate Chinese energy consumption. The national EC/GDP values have shown a declining trend from 2005 to date, indicating that the policy instruments are very important to mitigate climate change as regards reducing EC/GDP. The technological improvement regulations have made the greatest contribution to date to reduce EC/GDP values. The experiences from the Beijing and Shandong province indicate that their final targets in 2010 will be most likely achieved because the different provinces are not only following the national policy instruments but have also developed quite a few new instruments to assist in reaching the these reductions. Research limitations/implications – There are three limitations regarding Chinese policy instruments analysis. First, the paper does not go far to determine the other factors which can affect EC/GDP apart from policy instruments. Second, some data were lacking and there may be inaccuracies in the existing data that could affect the analysis results. Third, EC/GDP cannot reflect the Chinese contribution to mitigation of CO2 emissions if the composition of Chinese energy consumption changes significantly. Originality/value – The paper addresses the importance of various policy instruments in reducing EC/GDP.

Resource markets, in particular the oil market, are characterized by a large discrepancy between costs of resource extraction and commodity prices on international markets. We explain this observation in terms of (a) the intertemporal scarcity rent, (b) regional price differentials arising from trade and transport costs, (c) heterogeneity and inertia in the extraction sector. These effects are captured by the REMIND model. We use the model to explore economic effects of changes in coal, oil and gas markets induced by climate-change mitigation policies. A large share of fossil fuel reserves and resources will be used in the absence of climate policy leading to atmospheric GHG concentrations well beyond a level of 550 ppm CO2-eq. This result holds independently of different assumptions about energy demand and fossil fuel availability. Achieving ambitious climate targets will drastically reduce fossil fuel consumption, in particular the consumption of coal. Conventional oil and gas as well as non-conventional oil reserves are still exhausted. We find the net present value of fossil fuel rent until 2100 at 30tril.US$ with a large share of oil and a small share of coal. This is reduced by 9 and 12tril.US$ to achieve climate stabilization at 550 and 450 ppm CO2-eq, respectively. This loss is, however, overcompensated by revenues from carbon pricing that are 21 and 32tril.US$, respectively.

Developing countries are also trying to introduce balanced strategies of poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Globally, industrial civilization is being transformed to ecological civilization and green, low-carbon development is a global trend. Addressing climate change provides new strategic factors to further this development. China should take substantial actions to realize sustainable development in a new road: China is in the critical stage of changing its development mode, so it is vital to choose an appropriate development path. This extensive development comes at the high price of consuming too much resources and scarring the environment. Mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate change can help the transition of development. Based on the analysis of the development data of developed countries, the author introduces the concept of “two-type developed countries” with an understanding that not all developed countries must take the same development mode. He also holds the view that China should achieve modernization in a more energy-saving and more carbon-efficient manner compared with that of two-type developed countries. An analysis of “two competitions” that China is facing shows that changing the developing mode is urgent and China should grasp this opportunity in the next five to ten years, which is a key period for this transition. This paper discusses the low-carbon development goals and the three-step process. Low-carbon development does not necessarily restrict economic development. It, however, can expedite the transition of the development mode and this is a low-carbon and green development path. Transition of the development mode includes implementation of China’s green and low-carbon energy strategies, low-carbon society construction, development of agriculture and forestry, garbage sorting and utilization, innovation of urbanization, etc. Improvement of national infrastructure construction includes water safety, environment and climate monitoring system, intelligent energy web, basic database, etc. Addressing climate change can significantly improve the nation’s basic research level.

    "[46 ,0,0,\"Climate policy and analysis often focus on energy production and consumption, but seldom consider how energy transportation infrastructure shapes energy systems. US President Obama has recently brought these issues to the fore, stating that he would only approve the Keystone XL pipeline, connecting Canadian oil sands with US refineries and ports, if it 'does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution'. Here, we apply a simple model to understand the implications of the pipeline for greenhouse gas emissions as a function of any resulting increase in oil sands production. We find that for every barrel of increased production, global oil consumption would increase 0.6 barrels owing to the incremental decrease in global oil prices. As a result, and depending on the extent to which the pipeline leads to greater oil sands production, the net annual impact of Keystone XL could range from virtually none to 110 million tons CO2 equivalent annually. This spread is four times wider than found by the US State Department (1-27 million tons CO 2 e), who did not account for global oil market effects.

This paper discusses a hybrid of the mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regression model and BP (back propagation) neural network (MIDAS-BP model) to forecast carbon dioxide emissions. Such analysis uses mixed frequency data to study the effects of quarterly economic growth on annual carbon dioxide emissions. The forecasting ability of MIDAS-BP is remarkably better than MIDAS, ordinary least square (OLS), polynomial distributed lags (PDL), autoregressive distributed lags (ADL), and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models. The MIDAS-BP model is suitable for forecasting carbon dioxide emissions for both the short and longer term. This research is expected to influence the methodology for forecasting carbon dioxide emissions by improving the forecast accuracy. Empirical results show that economic growth has both negative and positive effects on carbon dioxide emissions that last 15 quarters.

The results indicate that there were long-run causalities from natural gas prices to natural gas consumption in both the residential and commercial sectors, as well as from electricity prices to electricity consumption in the commercial sector. Moreover, electricity and coal consumption were found to cause carbon dioxide emissions in the residential and commercial sectors, respectively. The short-run causality test found that natural gas consumption is the most sensitive toward changes in natural gas price in the residential sector, and electricity consumption is the most sensitive toward electricity prices in the commercial sector.

Meanwhile, the effects of cutting coal subsidies are more feasible than that of cutting oil subsidies overall. It is recommended to implement fossil energy subsidies gradually, cut the coal first and then cut oil subsidies successively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[50 ,0,0,\"This paper presents a methodology to allocate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that result from fuel combusted to produce electricity and heat to the end-use sectors (industry, buildings, transport, and agriculture) where the electricity and heat are actually consumed. Attributing these indirect emissions to the appropriate sectors results in a very different picture of CO2 emissions per sector than is seen when only direct emissions are characterized. With attribution to the demand side, the industrial and buildings sectors contribute the largest shares of CO2 emissions globally. When indirect emissions are allocated to their respective end-use sectors, the buildings sector's share of total emissions increases the most, from 9% (direct emissions only) to 31% (including indirect emissions), which reflects the large share of electricity and heat consumed in this sector. The share of CO2 emissions attributable to the industrial sector also increases significantly, from 18% to 37%. These increased values include emissions from both electricity and heat used in end-use sectors, in contrast to the traditional accounting method, which allocates all electricity and heat emissions to the transformation and energy sector. Allocating these emissions to end-use sectors makes it possible to assess the full potential impact of demand reduction of electricity and heat use.

    "[51 ,0,0,\"Analysis of the DICE model indicates that it contains unsupported assumptions, simple extrapolations, and misspecifications that cause it to understate the rate at which economic activity emits greenhouse gases and the rata at which the atmosphere retains greenhouse gases. The model assumes a world population that is 2 billion people lower than the 'base case' projected by demographers. The model extrapolates a decline in the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of economic activity that is possible only if there is a structural break in the economic and engineering factors that have determined this ratio over the last century. The model uses a single equation to simulate the rate at which greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. The forecast for the airborne fraction generated by this equation contradicts forecasts generated by models that represent the physical and chemical processes which determine the movement of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean. When these unsupported assumptions, simple extrapolations, and misspecifications are remedied with simple fixes, the economic impact of global climate change increases several fold. Similarly, these remedies increase the impact of uncertainty on estimates for the economic impact of global climate change. Together, these results indicate that considerable scientific and economic research is needed before the threat of climate change can be dismissed with any degree of certainty.\"],\n",

This includes the parameters of power, engine size and weight, which beyond the technological efficiency of the motor engine itself, are considered to be the main determinants of the fuel efficiency of the average car stock. Investigating the drivers of ever rising transport related greenhouse gas emissions is crucial in order to derive policies that strive towards more energy-efficient on-road passenger mobility. We focus on the efficacy of technological efficiency improvements in mitigating climate-relevant emissions from car use in light of shifting demand patterns towards bigger, heavier and more powerful cars. The analysis is descriptive in nature and based on a bottom-up database that was originally collated for the purpose of the present study. Technological data on car models, which includes tested fuel consumption, engine size, power and weight, is related to registered car stock and, in parts, to newly registered cars. From this, we obtain an original database of the Austrian passenger car fleet, i.e. information on consumer choice of specific car models, segregated by gasoline and diesel fuelled engines. Conclusions are derived for policies aimed at reducing the fossil fuel consumption of the moving vehicle fleet in order to contribute to a low carbon society. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    "[53 ,0,0,\"Stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will require significant cuts in electric sector carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The ability to capture and sequester CO2 in a manner compatible with today's fossil-fuel based power generation infrastructure offers a potentially low-cost contribution to a larger climate change mitigation strategy. The extent to which carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies might lower the cost of CO2 control in competitive electric markets will depend on how they displace existing generating units in a system's dispatch order, as well as on their competitiveness with abatement alternatives. This paper assumes a perspective intermediate to the more common macro-economic or plant-level analyses of CCS and employs an electric system dispatch model to examine how natural gas prices, sunk capital, and the availability of coal plant retrofits affect CCS economics. Despite conservative assumptions about cost, CCS units are seen to provide significant reductions in baseload CO2 emissions at a carbon price below 100$/tC. In addition, the ability to retrofit coal plants for post-combustion CO2 capture is not seen to lower the overall cost of CO2 abatement. © 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\"],\n",

    "[55 ,0,0,\"Long-term environmental consequences of taxing fossil fuel usage have been extensively studied in the literature. However, these taxes may also impose several short-run macroeconomic policy challenges, the nature of which remains underexplored. This paper investigates the mechanisms through which environmental taxes on fossil fuel usage can affect the main macroeconomic variables in the short-run. We concentrate on a particular mechanism: speculative storage. Formulating and using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, calibrated for the United States, with an explicit storage facility and nominal rigidities, we show that in designing environmental tax policies it is crucial to account for the fact that fossil fuel prices are subject to speculation. The existence of forward-looking speculators in the model improves the effectiveness of tax policies in reducing fossil fuel usage. Improved policy effectiveness, however, is costly: it drives inflation and interest rates up, while impeding output. Based on this tradeoff, we seek an answer to the question how monetary policy should interact with environmental tax policies in our DSGE model of fossil fuel storage. We show that, in an environment with no speculative storers, monetary policy should respond to output along with CPI inflation in order to minimize the welfare losses brought by taxes. However, when the storage facility is activated, responding to output in the monetary policy rule becomes less desirable. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

The renewable (RE) and non-renewable energy (NRE) options available were assessed through the lifecycle approach to determine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emission (LCGHG) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) per MWh of electricity. Considering historical electricity consumption, annual GDP and population growth from 1965, energy consumption for the year 2035 was forecasted using support vector machine regressor in Weka. Future plans in energy diversification pathways were examined through various scenario multi-objective optimizations with a constraint on resource availability and energy target using genetic algorithm in MATLAB.

System-wide analysis of the flexibility potential of TES necessitates representation of dynamic thermal models in large-scale power systems models. Therefore, this study presents a novel Building-to-Grid (B2G) model integrating buildings' thermal dynamics and end-use constraints with a security-constrained unit commitment model for energy and reserve scheduling. The behaviour of residential thermal demand is represented through linear state space (RC-equivalent) models for different residential archetypes. The B2G model is subsequently used to evaluate the energy arbitrage and reserve provision potential of TES for a test system and various sensitivity analyses for wind penetration levels and presence of other flexibility options have been conducted. The optimisation results highlight the significant value of TES in terms of annual generation cost savings, reserve provision, peak load reduction and utilization of wind energy.

    "[59 ,0,0,\"The Middle East region is a key player in the world energy market today. It holds approximately over 50% of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves. Yet, the region is significantly challenged by the large dependence on finite fossil fuel resources in its primary energy supply. The intricate relationship between climate change mitigation and the development of energy systems underlines great uncertainty over the future of energy development in the Middle East. Such uncertainty is greatly linked to growing energy demands and the region's capacity to transition to low-carbon energy systems. Over the past 20 years, the total primary energy demand in the Middle has almost tripled due to rapid population growth and economic development. Notably, most of the growing energy demand was concentrated in 5 countries, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE. These 5 countries represented around 82% of the total primary energy demand in 2015, with Saudi Arabia and Iran alone accounted for 60%. The core question of this paper is what are the possible implications of growing energy demands in these countries and which sectors will entail significant increases in the projected energy requirements? The significance of the work presented here stems from analyzing 4 major countries that constitute the largest share in Middle East's total energy consumption and associated emissions. Examining these 4 countries together is important to highlight how future increase in these countries could largely affect the overall energy demand from the Middle East region in the next 20 years. Thus, the scope of the paper is looking at energy demand implications in 4 countries, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Iraq is excluded from the analysis due to the large political uncertainty associated with Iraq's energy development. Here, a regression model is used to forecast energy demand from 5 economic sectors across the 4 countries using projected increase in population and gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. Results indicate that most of the projected energy demand will be from Iran and Saudi Arabia. In addition, industry and transportation sectors will witness the largest increase among the 5 sectors examined in the paper. For instance, industry and transportation sector will collectively account for 52% and 67% of the projected energy demand in Iran and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Such results are important to highlight when ascertaining sectoral level implications of future energy demands and to determine potential areas where energy savings can be made.

Through this study an attempt is made to project the corresponding carbon dioxide emissions and temperature variation in India using Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model on past 44 years' data for predicting the future demand of petroleum oil, coal and natural gas in India. It is anticipated that the total demand for petroleum products will double by the year 2020 growing at a rate of 3.5 percent per year. The consumption of coal has witnessed an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent and the growth of natural gas is likely to be highest among all at 5.1 percent. In total, the fossil fuel consumption seems to grow at the rate of 4 percent per annum. This may cause the CO2 level to rise to one and half times by the year 2020 in comparison to that of 2008 level thus causing an increase in the surface temperature by 0.0008 percent per annum.

    "[62 ,0,0,\"Energy consumption in the transport sector depends almost exclusively on fossil fuels - oil. The forecasts show a growing tendency of this sector in the following years. The price of oil on global markets continues to remain high. Peak oil production is predicted to start shortly or even that it has been already started (Narodoslawsky, 2007; Robelius, 2007; The Oil Drum). At the same time, a significant rise in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is raising the earth's temperature and is causing climate change (Hamilton, 2008). Therefore it is important to take actions towards energy efficiency, emissions reductions, fuel supply security, and low-carbon economy. Biomass is renewable only if production is sustainable. Also, different research studies have showed that lower carbon footprints are achieved by utilizing biomass, when compared to energy generated from fossil sources. On the other hand higher amounts of nitrogen are emitted into air and water (Cherubini and Strømman, 2011; Bauer, 2008; ?u?ek et al., 2011). This contribution focuses on the simultaneous integration of different technologies for converting starchy and lignocellulosic raw materials to bioethanol. Different paths are selected: biochemical, thermo-chemical and thermo-biochemical and integrated in one superstructure so that operating costs, energy and agricultural land are minimized and profit is maximized. The ethanol production is assumed to be centralized. Raw materials are assumed to grow on the agricultural area of the maximum of 50 000 hectares. The fossil energy used in the supply chain of bioethanol production is also calculated and analyzed. The degree of (un)sustainability of the bioethanol production system is evaluated by the carbon and nitrogen footprint and compared to gasoline supply chain. Multi-objective optimization is performed on bioethanol supply chain where net footprints are minimized. The optimization of the system is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The problem is solved by the use of the Mixed-Integer Process Synthesizer MIPSYN using mass and energy balances and other constraints with profit maximization as the optimization criterion.\"],\n",

Construction of an accurate and reliable prediction model for the volatility changes in energy consumption can provide valuable reference information for policy makers of the government and for the energy industry. In view of this, a novel improved model is developed in this article by integrating the modified state transition algorithm (MSTA) with the Gaussian processes regression (GPR) approach for non-fossil energy consumption predictions for China at the end of the 13th Five-Year Project, in which the MSTA is utilized for effective optimization of hyper-parameters in GPR. Aiming for validating the superiority of MSTA, several comparisons are conducted on two well-known functions and the optimization results show the effectiveness of modification in the state transition algorithm (STA). Then, based on the latest statistical renewable energy consumption data, the MSTA-GPR model is utilized to generate consumption predictions for overall renewable energy and each single renewable energy source, including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other energies, respectively.

The Chinese government is performing the industrial reforms to diminishing the dependence of industrial output on fossil energy consumption. To guide the present industrial policy adjustment, this study employs the Tapio decoupling index, a structural decomposition algorithm, a hybrid forecasting model, and industry-related data from 2001 to 2014 to evaluate, decompose and forecast the relationship between China's industrial output and fossil energy consumption. Empirical results show that the decoupling index of fossil energy consumption from the value added by China's industry was less than 0 in 2015. Consequently, the industrial fossil energy consumption reached its peak at that time and will gradually decrease in the future, even though the added value continuously increased. The mitigation goals set by the Chinese government for industrial fossil energy intensity by 2020 are expected to be achieved ahead of schedule. The attainment of these goals will strongly support the realization of China's fossil energy-related prospects for 2030. To reduce industrial fossil energy consumption, China should develop strategies for non-fossil energy electricity generation, implement electricity price bidding, prevent overheated investments to real estate and infrastructure, and eliminate backward capacity and establish market-access rules for acetic acid, calcium carbide, ethyl alcohol, and dimethyl ether. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

This paper analyzes how these three major revisions correspond to data on China's energy use from 1996 to 2012, and theirs impacts on CO2 emissions, emission intensity and the share of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption, which are key indicators of China's climate policies. Some notable changes include CO2 emissions for 2012, which increased by 594 Million tons – a figure equivalent to South Korea's annual emissions, which implies that China's emissions at peak level will be higher than previous estimation. Meanwhile, revised emission intensity data show a higher amount and lower decreasing rate, which means that China's achievements in decreasing emission intensity during 2005–2012 have been overestimated, while future difficulties for achieving the goal of 40–45% reduction will be greater. On the share of non-fossil fuel energy in China's total energy mix, the adjustments increased the indicator by 1.26%, reflecting the fact that China's effort in developing non-fossil energy had been underestimated. Discrepancies in reported scattered coal in different statistics versions are the main contributors to these changes. To further enhance the reliability of its energy statistics, and thereby its climate policies, China should remove incentives for misreporting through legal means, and make the technical system for data collection more comprehensive and accurate, with particular emphasis on scattered coal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

It uses a dynamic general equilibrium model which highlights the mechanisms of endogenous growth and includes a detailed modeling of the public sector. Fuel price scenarios are based on forecasts by the US Department of Energy (DOE-US), the International Energy Agency (IEA-OECD) and IHS Global Insight Inc. The differences in relative fuel prices among the three scenarios lead to substantially different environmental impacts. Higher fuel prices in the DOE-US scenario lead to a 10.2% reduction in the policy effort required to meet the EU 2020 emission targets, while relative price changes in the IEA-OECD scenario result in a 19.2% increase in the required policy effort and decreasing fuel prices increase the emissions deficit by 95.9% under the IHS scenario. In terms of the long term economic impacts, our results suggest a 2.2% reduction in GDP in the DOE-US scenario and 1.9% in the IEA-OECD scenario and an increase of 1.4% in the IHS scenario. As to the budgetary impact, higher fuel prices lead to lower tax revenues, which, coupled with a reduction in public spending translates to lower public deficits. From a methodological perspective, our results highlight the importance of the mechanisms of endogenous growth. A scenario of higher fuel prices would, under exogenous economic growth assumptions, result in larger baseline emissions growth, substantially smaller economic effects, and rather different budgetary effects. From a policy perspective, our results highlight the importance of fossil fuel prices in defining the level of policy intervention required for compliance with international and domestic climate change legislation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",
    "[68 ,0,0,\"Quoting a joint analysis made by the OECD and the IEA, G20 Leaders committed in September 2009 to 'rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption'. This analysis was based on the OECD ENV-Linkages General Equilibrium model and shows that removing fossil fuel subsidies in a number of non-OECD countries could reduce world Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 10% in 2050 ( OECD, 2009). Indeed, these subsidies are huge. IEA estimates indicate that total subsidies to fossil fuel consumption in 37 non-OECD countries in 2008 amounted to USD 557 billion ( IEA, OPEC, OECD, World Bank, 2010a, 2010b). This represents almost five times the yearly bilateral aid flows to developing countries as defined by the Official Development Assistance (ODA). This paper discusses the assumptions, data and both environmental and economic implications of removing these subsidies. It shows that, though removing these subsidies would amount to roughly a seventh of the effort needed to stabilize GHG concentration at a level of 450. ppm or below 2. °C, the full environmental benefit of this policy option can only be achieved if, in parallel, emissions are also capped in OECD countries. Finally, though removing these subsidies qualifies as being a 'win-win' option at the global level in terms of environmental and economic benefits, this is not true for all countries/regions. The paper also provides some discussion about the robustness of these results. © 2014 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy.\"],\n",

The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 20 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today's technology and electricity market fundamentals.

Population growth is used to calibrate a logistically evolving index of development that influences production efficiency. Energy production efficiency also includes a coefficient that decreases linearly with decreasing carbon intensity of energy production. This carbon intensity is a piecewise linear function of fossil carbon depletion. That function is calibrated against historical data and extrapolated by sampling a set of hypotheses about the impact on the carbon intensity of energy production of depleting fluid fossil fuel resources and increasing cumulative carbon emissions. Atmospheric carbon balance is determined by a first order differential equation with carbon use rates and cumulative carbon use as drivers. Atmospheric CO2 is a driver in a similar heat balance.

    "[76 ,0,0,\"This paper analyzed the total industrial energy consumption and energy-related carbon emission of Tianjin from 2003 to 2012. During 2008-2012, Tianjin's energy consumption of industrial added value decreased by 11.46%. The carbon dioxide emissions caused by industrial energy consumption of Tianjin increased year by year, with an average annual growth rate of 9.11% from 2005 to 2012, but the carbon emission intensity decreased by 53.17% during the same period. Using these energy consumption data, a model was able to predict the future with a high degree of accuracy to check if the target can be achieved that reduce its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 18% and carbon emission per unit GDP by 17% during the '12th Five-Year' period. Additionally, an energy decomposition analysis indicated that while the scale of production played a major role in the growth of industrial energy consumption, the intensity of energy played a major role in slowing the growth. These results show that energy-saving efforts and the optimization of the industrial structure have increased the energy efficiency of Tianjin. To achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction, the development of green and low-carbon industries and energy structure adjustments are needed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[77 ,0,0,\"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the resilience of possible future electricity and heating systems in regard to climate change and fuel price shocks. The dynamical simulation model HiREPS of the Austrian and German electricity, heating and cooling sectors was used for this analysis. The electricity generation cost and changes in the required secured capacity were used as indicators for the resilience of the energy system. The results show, that the analysed changes in the natural gas price have larger impact on the electricity generation cost than weather variability between different years or climate change. Especially the fossil fuel based scenario showed high sensitivity to the gas price. Analysis of the required secured capacity shows, that in the last quarter of the 21st century the annual maximum residual loads are growing and are dominated by strong cooling demand peaks. Promoting passive cooling options, efficient building designs and options for a controlled down regulation of cooling devices seems to be advisable to avoid installing large thermal power plant backup capacities.

    "[78 ,0,0,\"Energy planning models (EPMs) play an indispensable role in policy formulation and energy sector development. The forecasting of energy demand and supply is at the heart of an EPM. Different forecasting methods, from statistical to machine learning have been applied in the past. The selection of a forecasting method is mostly based on data availability and the objectives of the tool and planning exercise. We present a systematic and critical review of forecasting methods used in 483 EPMs. The methods were analyzed for forecasting accuracy; applicability for temporal and spatial predictions; and relevance to planning and policy objectives. Fifty different forecasting methods were identified. Artificial neural network (ANN) is the most widely used method, which is applied in 40% of the reviewed EPMs. The other popular methods, in descending order, are: support vector machine (SVM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), fuzzy logic (FL), linear regression (LR), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey prediction (GM) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA). Regarding accuracy, computational intelligence (CI) methods demonstrate better performance than that of the statistical ones, in particular for parameters with greater variability in the source data. Moreever, hybrid methods yield better accuracy than that of the stand-alone ones. Statistical methods are used for only short and medium range, while CI methods are preferable for all temporal forecasting ranges (short, medium and long). Based on objective, most EPMs focused on energy demand and load forecasting. In terms, geographical coverage, the highest number of EPMs were developed in China. However, collectively, more models were established for the developed countries than the developing ones. Findings would benefit researchers and professionals in gaining an appreciation of the forecasting methods and enable them to select appropriate method(s) to meet their needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

It further examines possible industry responses, and identifies and provides a preliminary evaluation of potential opportunities to mitigate these impacts. The industry sectors investigated - steel, aluminum, chemicals and paper - are among the largest industrial users of fossil fuels in the US economy. The results of this examination show that climate policies that put a price on carbon could have substantial impacts on the competitiveness of US energy-intensive manufacturing sectors over the next two decades, if climate regulations are applied only in the United States, and no action is taken to invest in advanced low- and no-carbon technologies. The extent of these impacts will vary across industries, depending on their energy intensities, the mix of energy sources they rely on and how energy is used in production activities (heat and power, feedstock). Of relevance is also the speed and rigor with which industries adopt new technologies and retire (or replace) old ones. Other factors affecting these impacts include an industry's vulnerability to foreign imports and its ability to pass through cost increases to its customers in the face of international market competition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) shared with electricity generation by fuel source was explored. Using seasonal autoregressive integrated weighted average (ARIMA) and seasonal simple exponentially smoothed models, retrospective time series analysis was run. The hypothesized relationship between climatic variability and total electricity generation was supported, where an ARIMA model including CDDs as a predictor explained 57.6% of the variability. The hypothesis that climatic variability would be more predictive of fossil fuel electricity generation than electricity produced by clean energy sources was partially supported. The ARIMA model for natural gas indicated that CDDS were the only predictor for the fossil fuel source, and that 79.4% of the variability was explained. Climatic variability was not predictive of electricity generation from coal or petroleum, where simple seasonal exponentially smoothed models emerged. However, HDDs were a positive predictor of hydroelectric electricity production, where 48.9% of the variability in the clean energy source was explained by an ARIMA model.

    "[81 ,0,0,\"The use of renewable energy sources (RES) has continuously increased throughout the last decade. In the residential building sector the trend goes towards energy supply systems based on multiple RES. This is mainly due to political requirements, governmental subsidies and fuel price development. These systems not only require an optimal design with respect to the installed capacities but also the right choice in combining the available technologies assuring a cost-effective solution. The aim of this paper is to present an optimization methodology for residential on-site energy supply systems based on mixed integer linear programming. The methodology chooses the right combination of technologies and sizes the components based on on-site weather data and expected consumption profiles. Through this approach the fluctuations of RES as well as the user behavior are taken into account already during the planning process. The methodology allows for specifying a level of Net Zero Energy Building (Net ZEB) performance to investigate cost reductions when allowing shares of fossil fuel consumption. The outcome is an optimal supply technology combination and optimal installed capacities in terms of the overall costs including system installation and operating expenses. The approach is applied to a case study of a residential single family house under Danish conditions. It delivers rapidly site-specific solutions and can easily be used as an extension for common building energy simulation software. In the case study several levels of Net ZEB performance have been investigated. The results show that supply systems based solely on renewable sources are still considerably more expensive than standard solutions and that substantial cost reductions can be reached by allowing a certain share of primary energy consumption. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.\"],\n",

This research aimed to perform an accurate model for forecasting and assessing CO2 emissions and the production of renewable electricity for the top two countries contributing to these emissions, the USA and China. In this study, we employed three novel advanced mathematical grey models: optimized discrete grey model (ODGM), nonhomogeneous discrete grey model (NDGM), and variable speed and adaptive structure grey model (VSSGM) to estimate the future trends of CO2 emissions and renewable electricity production. These breakthrough models added value in this field of research by reducing uncertainty surrounding ambiguity and numerical ranges and improving accuracy in assessments by using small samples and imperfect information. The findings showed that, by 2026, China’s electricity production based on renewable sources would be higher than that of the USA. We find CO2 emissions in a downward trend, with more significant reductions in the USA than in China by the year 2026. The contributions of this study are the application of novel VSSGM and the use of synthetic relative growth rate modeling for predicting the overall growth of CO2 emissions and the production of renewable electricity in analyzed countries. The originality of this study lies in proposing a novel synthetic doubling time model to compute how long it will take, for China and the USA, to reduce their CO2 emissions and doubling their increase in renewable electricity production. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"],\n",
    "[83 ,0,0,\"One of the motivations for the removal of subsidies on fossil fuels is that these subsidies lead to the over-consumption of energy, and as a result, undermine environmental quality. Despite the huge opportunities that removal of subsidies on fossil fuels may bring for climate change mitigation, empirical studies for Ghana have failed to appropriately test these links. For this reason, this study employs a multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to evaluate the welfare and environmental impacts from imported refined oil subsidies removal in Ghana. The simulation experiment shows evidence of welfare losses even if environmental benefits are accounted for. Although the rate of CO2 emissions appears to increase, there is an overall 1.9% improvement in environmental quality due to the removal of fuel subsidies. The results provided in this study imply that the removal of subsidies on energy should be implemented along with policies aimed at stimulating economic activities. In addition, the study has implications for the so-called ‘green paradox’. © 2016\"],\n",
    "[84 ,0,0,\"Geothermal resource assessment requires several input parameters at a time when field information is normally very limited. The power plant efficiency is an important parameter as it affects investment cost and profit. However, there is significant debate in the geothermal industry on the appropriate performance measure to implement. In this paper we attempt to determine the best performance measures for financial decision making during the exploration stage of geothermal power developments. We compare and contrast current performance measures commonly used by the geothermal industry. This includes thermal efficiency, geothermal brine effectiveness, utilisation efficiency and enthalpy efficiency. We show that enthalpy efficiency, categorised by the geothermal reservoir enthalpy, is the best financial performance measure because it is similar to other measures on most criteria, but superior in terms of comparability across different geothermal sites, while satisfying homoscedasticity. Utilisation efficiency, on the other hand, was demonstrated to have the least reliability while requiring additional input parameters. We recommend using the modified enthalpy efficiency developed in this work for resource assessment of new geothermal fields, benchmarking with existing development and for comparison with conventional fossil-fuel thermal plants. This should also affect the choice of resource assessment methodology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[85 ,0,0,\"For a transitional economy such as China, some energy subsidies are reasonable, and sometimes even necessary for achieving social goals. However, with rising energy prices and environmental concerns, we see conflicts emerging between energy subsidies, energy demand/supply fundamentals and climate change considerations. Energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy use, efficiency and the choice of fuel source. This paper applies the price-gap approach to estimate China's energy subsidies. Results indicate that China's energy subsidies amounted to CNY 356.73 billion in 2007, equivalent to 1.43% of GDP. Subsidies for oil products consumption are the largest, followed by subsidies for the electricity and coal sectors. Furthermore, a CGE model is used to analyze the economic impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our findings show that removing energy subsidies will result in a significant fall in energy demand and emissions, but will have negative impacts on macroeconomic variables. We conclude that offsetting policies could be adopted such that certain shares of these subsidies are reallocated to support other sustainable development measures, which could lead to reducing energy intensity and favoring the environment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

Climate change is expected to further increase the likelihood and severity of future droughts. Simultaneously, population and industrial growth increases demand for drought-stressed water resources and energy, including electricity. In the US, nearly half of water withdrawals are for electricity generation, much of which comes from greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuel combustion. The result is a three-way tension among efforts to meet growing energy demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water withdrawals, a critical issue within the so-called water-energy nexus. We focus on this interaction within the electric sector by using a generation expansion planning model to explore the trade-offs. We show that large reductions in CO 2 emissions would probably increase water withdrawals for electricity generation in the absence of limits on water usage, and that simultaneous restriction of CO 2 emissions and water withdrawals requires a different mix of energy technologies and higher costs than one would plan to reduce either CO 2 or water alone. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this context, the long-term prediction of energy demand plays a key role in planning energy infrastructures and in adopting economic and energy policies. In this article, we aimed to forecast energy demand for Spain, mainly employing econometrics techniques. From information obtained from institutional databases, energy demand was decomposed into many factors and economy-related activity sectors, obtaining a set of disaggregated sequences of time-dependent values. Using time-series techniques, a long-term prediction was then obtained for each component. Finally, every element was aggregated to obtain the final long-term energy demand forecast. For the year 2030, an energy demand equivalent to 82 million tons of oil was forecast. Due to improvements in energy efficiency in the post-crisis period, a decoupling of economy and energy demand was obtained, with a 30% decrease in energy intensity for the period 2005–2030. World future scenarios show a significant increase in energy demand due to human development of less developed economies. For Spain, our research concluded that energy demand will remain stable in the next decade, despite the foreseen 2% annual growth of the nation’s economy. Despite the enormous energy concentration and density of fossil fuels, it will not be affordable to use them to supply energy demand in the future.

    "[88 ,0,0,\"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term equilibrium relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and total biomass consumption (BC) in Turkey, which has a rich diversity of ecological conditions prevailing throughout its regions. Design/methodology/approach - Bounds tests and conditional error correction models under the autoregressive distributed lag approach have been applied to annual data that cover the 1980-2010 period. Findings - Results suggest that CO2 emissions are in a long-term equilibrium relationship with total BC in Turkey. BC has a negative effect on CO2 emissions; 1 per cent increase in total BC would lead to 0.029 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions. Long-term coefficient of fossil fuel consumption for CO2 emissions is positive and elastic, 1.247. Finally, conditional error correction model of the present study reveals that CO2 emission in Turkey converges to its economic long-term equilibrium very quickly by 93.7 per cent speed of adjustment through the channel of BC and fossil fuel consumption. Originality/value - Although there have been a considerable number of studies investigating the link between total energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the literature, searching the contribution of components of energy to CO2 emissions deserves attention. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of BC on CO2 emissions in the case of Turkey. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"],\n",
    "[89 ,0,0,\"Considering the dramatic increase of greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, reduction of these gases seems necessary to combat global warming. Fossil fuel power plants are one of the main sources of CO2 emission and several methods are under development to capture CO2 from power plants. In this paper, CO2 capture from a natural gas fired steam cycle power plant using oxyfuel combustion technology is studied. Oxy-fuel combustion is an interesting option since CO2 concentration in the flue gas is highly increased. The Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) developed by Carnegie Mellon University (USA) is used to evaluate the effect of this capture technology on the plant efficiency and economic parameters of the system. The IECM uses regression models based on other studies to evaluate the required energy for oxygen production unit (air separation unit) and CO2 purification and compression unit. In this work, these two units are simulated using the Aspen Plus software in parallel with the IECM, and the results are compared with the results of the IECM. This comparison verified that the power requirement evaluations from the IECM performance model and the Aspen Plus software are approximately the same. Since CO2 capture and transport are cost and energy intensive, the cost of electricity (COE) in capture plants increases significantly. According to the assumptions in this study, the cost of electricity for both the base plant and the capture plant are calculated using the IECM cost model. The cost of electricity for the base plant is equal to 66.8 $/MWh while the cost of electricity for the capture plant is 123.7 $/MWh. In addition, cost of CO2 avoided can be calculated by using the cost of electricity and CO2 emission rate in the base and capture plants. If CO2 storage cost or CO2 benefit is not considered, the cost of CO 2 avoided is about 104 $/ton CO2 for a 237 MW power plant. However, it is shown in this study that if the captured CO2 is used for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the nearby oil fields (assuming 100 km distance), the revenue gained can compensate for the extra cost of electricity produced by the oxy-fuel combustion natural gas steam cycle and consequently reduces the cost of CO2 avoided. A rule of thumb is used to evaluate the amount of EOR revenues. According to this rule of thumb, 0.25 ton of crude oil is recovered per ton of CO2 injected. A relation between gas and oil price is therefore required to consider an integrated natural gas fired steam power plant, CO2 pipeline and oil field as an overall system. Assuming that natural gas price is a function of oil price, a rough estimation of oil price in which Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is economically feasible can be found. In this study, the relationship between oil and gas price is based on a polynomial function. This function is determined according to the time series information of natural gas and oil price in recent years (1997-2008) in the United States. The prices of these fuels in Iran were not used because the prices are heavily subsidized. The results show that at high oil prices, about $60/bbl, all the costs of CO2 capture and transport to oil field can be compensated by EOR revenues which makes the integrated power plant and CCS with EOR economically feasible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

In fact, a one ton of oil equivalent permanent reduction in aggregate energy consumption reduces output by €6340 over the long term, an aggregate impact which hides a wide diversity of effects for different fuel types. More importantly, and since carbon dioxide emissions are linearly related to the amounts of fuel consumed, our results allow us to estimate the costs of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from different energy sources.

An important policy implication is that, once the overall economic costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions are considered, fuel switching is a no-regrets environmental policy capable of reducing carbon dioxide emissions without jeopardizing economic activity and indeed with the potential for generating favorable economic outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "[97 ,0,0,\"Coal was central to the industrial revolution, but in the 20th century it increasingly was superseded by oil and gas. However, in recent years coal again has become the predominant source of global carbon emissions. We show that this trend of rapidly increasing coal-based emissions is not restricted to a few individual countries such as China. Rather, we are witnessing a global renaissance of coal majorly driven by poor, fast-growing countries that increasingly rely on coal to satisfy their growing energy demand. The low price of coal relative to gas and oil has played an important role in accelerating coal consumption since the end of the 1990s. In this article, we show that in the increasingly integrated global coal market the availability of a domestic coal resource does not have a statistically significant impact on the use of coal and related emissions. These findings have important implications for climate change mitigation: If future economic growth of poor countries is fueled mainly by coal, ambitious mitigation targets very likely will become infeasible. Building new coal power plant capacities will lead to lock-in effects for the next few decades. If that lock-in is to be avoided, international climate policy must find ways to offer viable alternatives to coal for developing countries. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Solar heat for industrial processes is an emerging solution that has yet to reach its true potential.

However, the analysis is characterized by a certain degree of uncertainty due to the assumptions made, that influence the final decision. Hence, the profitability of renewable energy-based solutions can either be overvalued or undervalued when compared to a fossil fuel-based solution. In this paper, the solar heat potential for the industry in Romania is calculated. Then, a past to present analysis is performed in order to assess the real benefits an industrial energy consumer would have gained had he considered a few years back to cover a fraction of its heat consumption with a solar heat source, by using the real historic data regarding the energy market evolution.

The GEM provides a close match of the historical energy mix dating back to the year 1850 and is then used to make forecasts for the future. Originally developed in 2007, the GEM was used to project the energy mix to the year 2030. In the present paper, the validity of the original projection is tested against the most recently available data. The GEM estimates the fractional contribution of different primary energy sources to the global market. In total, there are six parameters that allow the GEM equation to give the best possible match of the historical energy mix. Using the estimated parameter values, the model can then be extended into the future, providing a reference case and alternative scenarios of the energy mix based on evolving unconventional, conventional and renewable resource quantities, costs, technologies, economic growth, population and policies. The original GEM findings from 2007 forecasted a '2030 1/3 forecast', indicating that solids, liquids and gases would each occupy a third of the energy market in the year 2030. After further disaggregating the categories, it was found that liquids, mostly, oil would experience a declining market share by 2030 while natural gas would see a rapid rise. The share solids, mostly coal, was relatively flat by that time. Our new results show continued penetration of natural gas in the energy mix - a result consistent with efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Our proposed paper is novel in that it uses the most recent statistics of the last 10 years on consumption of different energy sources to verify the accuracy of the original GEM projections carried out in 2007.

In order to do this, a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model has been estimated to evaluate the impact of subsidies removal on imported refined oil in Ghana on prices, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, households' demand, firm's production and real GDP. The simulation experiment points to evidence that subsidy removal raises prices, increases the rate of CO2 emissions, reduces households' demand, reduces aggregate output and affects various sectors differently. The increased rate of CO2 emissions due to the removal of subsidies is indicative of the existence of the so-called ‘green paradox’. These results underscore the fact that a removal of subsidies on fossil fuels may win in some regards but fail in others. A general implication from the applied model, therefore, is one which supports the assertion that removal of subsidies on fossil fuels removal on energy should be implemented along with policies aimed at stimulating economic activities and reducing the level of CO2 emissions, especially where there is evidence of the ‘green paradox’. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[103,0,0,\"Canada is the only country to have ratified the Kyoto protocol and then withdrawn. Part of the justification for Canada's reluctance to commit to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions is the country's status as fossil fuel exporter. In this paper we use input-output analysis and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to ask whether Canada's contribution to global GHG emissions changes when calculated using a demand-based shadow emission approach that excludes GHG emissions created in the production of exports like fossil fuels, but includes emissions released to produce imports to Canada. We find that from 1995 to 2005 Canada's contribution to global emissions was lower using this demand-based GHG accounting approach than a production-based approach. From 2006 to 2009 however, increased imports from GHG-intensive trading partners like China meant that Canada's demand-based shadow emissions were higher than its production-based GHG emissions.We also introduce a method of calculating sub-national GHG shadows using limited data. Applied to Canada this exercise demonstrates that fossil fuel exporting provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan have demand-based shadow emissions significantly lower than their production-based emissions, while populous provinces such as Quebec and Ontario have demand-based emissions that are relatively higher than their production-based emissions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..\"],\n",
    "[104,0,0,\"Over the 1970s and 1980s, emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use fell in per capita, per unit GDP, and in some cases in absolute terms in 10 industrialized countries studied by LBNL. These declines were driven principally by falling end-use energy intensities and the decreasing carbon content of energy. By the early 1990s, however, a slowdown in the decline of intensities and the continued growth of GDP and energy services activity have reversed the trends in absolute emissions. LBNL concludes that CO2 emissions will continue to rise in the future unless energy intensities and/or the carbon content of energy can be decreased at an accelerated rate via policy changes, technological innovation and/or behavioural adaptation. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.\"],\n",

Reforming energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy price, energy use and CO2 emission. This paper applies a price-gap approach to estimate China's fossil-fuel related subsidies with the consideration of the external cost. Results indicate that the magnitude of subsidies amounted to CNY 1214.24 billion in 2008, equivalent to 4.04% of GDP of that year. Subsidies for oil products are the largest, followed by subsidies for the coal and electricity. Furthermore, an input-output model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidies reform on different industries and general price indexes. The findings show that removal of energy subsidies will have significant impact on energy-intensive industry, and consequently push up the general price level, yet with a small variation. Removing oil products subsidies will have the largest impact, followed by electricity, coal and natural gas. However, no matter which energy price increases, PPI is always the most affected, then GDP deflator, with CPI being the least. Corresponding compensation measures should be accordingly designed to offset the negative impact caused by energy subsidies reform. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[106,0,0,\"The increasing costs of energy and water, fossil fuel depletion, and food shortages caused by climate change challenge long-term sustainability of food, energy, and water (FEW) systems. In working toward sustainable development, a fundamental question for deciding on whether and how to invest in FEW systems is “how sustainable FEW systems are?”. In order to measure sustainability across the FEW systems, an integrated sustainability index (SI) is developed. The SI is comprised of three components; food, energy, and water. These components each consist of different sub-components (e.g. transportation fuel for energy component) that make up integrated FEW systems. The sustainability of an FEW system can be calculated using the integrated FEW SI, but a more thought provoking question is to understand how each sub-component affects overall sustainability of the system. This cannot be achieved without formulating the interconnections associated with FEW components. This study formulates interconnections associated with FEW components. In an effort to increase the degree to which the results would generalize to FEW systems with different scales, the calculations of the study are performed for a sustainable FEW system that can consistently yield food for a family of four (two adults and two children) and supply its own water and energy needs from sustainable sources. Also, the sustainability is measured for two systems located in two different climates; one is relatively cloudy and humid and the other is sunny and arid. The results show that the highest sustainability improvement in both climates is associated with irrigation sub-component. Not only a sustainable water supply for irrigation sub-component improves the sustainability of water component, it also improves food sustainability and consequently energy sustainability. This finding can be explained by the fact that the irrigation sub-component is a resource supplier for grain sub-component, and that is a resource supplier for transportation fuel sub-component. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

The results depict a unidirectional causality running from gross domestic product per capita to CO2EFFCO for the USA, China, and Canada. However, no causality direction was found for Nigeria. Furthermore, with the quest to achieve cleaner energy targets, we formulate long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm devoid of exogenous variables and assumptions required to forecast CO2EFFCO for the USA, China, Canada, and Nigeria.

    "[108,0,0,\"Subsidies to fossil-fuel consumption have made Chinas energy system fragile and unsustainable. It is necessary for China to reform fossil-fuel subsidies and reflect the resource cost and environmental cost in energy prices. Considering the life-cycle external costs, this paper estimates the scale of fossil-fuel subsidy and the true cost of renewable energy in 2010 and evaluates impacts of increasing renewable energy subsidies and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies on macro-economy and energy system in China based on scenario analysis. Simulation results show that the negative impacts on economic growth can be reduced from 4.460% to 0.432%, if only 10% of fossil fuel subsidies were removed. Increasing subsidies for renewable energy has positive impacts on macroeconomic variables. Although the economic benefits per unit of subsidies for renewable energy are lower than those for fossil fuels by 0.06-0.19 CNY, the revenue gap can be narrowed by shifting more subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables. Increasing subsidies for renewable energy helps optimize Chinas energy system in three ways: the first is making energy consumption structure cleaner; the second is improving energy efficiency; and the third is addressing the problem of imbalanced distribution and consumption of energy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[109,0,0,\"The absence of US national action on global climate change policy has prompted initiatives by the US Congress, cities, states, and regions toward what is likely to become a long-term, collaborative effort to harmonize national energy and climate policies. This upward evolution in the face of a reluctant administration is historically consistent with the development of national legislation on other environmental and social issues in the US. At the heart of this movement is the need to resolve conflicts between high-intensity use of low-cost fossil energy supplies, and the dominating impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global climate change. US states are among the largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world and play a critical role in supplying and transforming energy, as well as consuming it, for economic advantage. State governments are also likely to have to shoulder some of the cost of potentially extensive climate damages and bear the brunt of the cost of implementing future federal mandates. As a result, many are taking proactive stances on the development of climate mitigation policy to prepare for, accelerate, and/or guide national policy. As US states show leadership on addressing greenhouse gas emissions, they also play an important role in forging policies and measures that reduce economic conflict between energy and climate goals. A number have launched or completed greenhouse gas mitigation plans and other major policies in the past few years that address these conflicts through: (1) finding ways to reduce mitigation costs, including the use of incentive-based policy instruments; (2) promoting an open and democratic policy process that includes major stakeholders; (3) promoting equity across socioeconomic groups, regions, and generations; and (4) promoting interregional cooperation. The results are promising and suggest that the state arena for climate and energy policy is evolving quickly and constructively toward alternatives that reduce conflict. Regional efforts are also unfolding, along with greater congressional attention to the lessons learned and commitments made by sub-federal actions. In the next few years many national energy and climate conflicts are likely to be tested and addressed by states. Among these, Pennsylvania is likely to be an important player due to its high profile of energy production and potential for leadership. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\"],\n",

We employ a three-stage least squares model that explains changes in fuel use as a function of changes in three fuel prices. This model is repeated across sub-samples of data aggregated at the plant level and operating holding company level. We expect that plants and holding companies reduce fuel use when fuel prices rise. Several fuel substitution effects within and across plants and holding companies are demonstrated, as well as several frictions. At the plant level, higher prices of natural gas lead to less natural gas consumption, less coal consumption, and more fuel oil consumption. At the operating holding company level, results demonstrate the inelasticity of coal use and the increases of natural gas in response to higher coal prices. Subsamples demonstrate heterogeneity of results across different plants.

While the rate of annual increase in consumption of oil, gas and coal is 1.4Mb, 4.5BCF and 3.1million tons (Mt). Global annual energy demand of over 12billion tons of oil equivalent (BTOE) results in the emission of 39.5Giga tons of carbon dioxide (Gt-CO2), and the annual CO2 emission would increase up to 75 Gt-CO2 when future energy demand will rise to 24-25BTOE.

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the research conducted on peak coal and summarizes the influencing factors, forecast methods, and forecast results of peak coal. This review has ascertained that the key premises of peak coal forecasts mainly rely on historical coal production and reserves, which excludes the effects of other factors such as the market, resource, technology, environment, transport, safety, new energy and policy. In addition, the data standards and ports of the historical data are not uniform, and the scenario analysis forecasting method is less than the trend extrapolation forecasting method. All of our findings demonstrate great deviations between the forecasting outcomes and the actual situations of China's peak coal. The use of realistic factors of China's situation should be a precondition to improving the distortion of the current forecasting of peak coal. These factors should include the macroeconomic slowdown, forced carbon emission reductions, supply-side reforms, and new energy shocks, which will be the key constraints in remodeling the forecasts of peak coal. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",
    "[115,0,0,\"In this paper we present an empirical analysis of the residential demand for electricity using annual aggregate data at the state level for 48 US states from 1995 to 2007. Earlier literature has examined residential energy consumption at the state level using annual or monthly data, focusing on the variation in price elasticities of demand across states or regions, but has failed to recognize or address two major issues. The first is that, when fitting dynamic panel models, the lagged consumption term in the right-hand side of the demand equation is endogenous. This has resulted in potentially inconsistent estimates of the long-run price elasticity of demand. The second is that energy price is likely mismeasured.To address these issues, we estimate a dynamic partial adjustment model using the Kiviet corrected Least Square Dummy Variables (LSDV) (1995) and the Blundell-Bond (1998) estimators. We find that the long-term elasticities produced by the Blundell-Bond system GMM methods are largest, and that from the bias-corrected LSDV are greater than that from the conventional LSDV. From an energy policy point of view, the results obtained using the Blundell-Bond estimator where we instrument for price imply that a carbon tax or other price-based policy may be effective in discouraging residential electricity consumption and hence curbing greenhouse gas emissions in an electricity system mainly based on coal and gas power plants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

Improving energy efficiency is seen as an important means of reducing emissions, but absolute reductions in global energy use remain elusive because of continued growth in the numbers of important energy-using devices such as transport vehicles, and energy rebound. Limiting the rise in average surface temperature above preindustrial to 2 °C is widely regarded as the limit for avoiding dangerous anthropogenic climate change. Given the magnitude of CO2 emission reductions necessary for this limit to be met, other approaches are needed for reducing energy use and its resultant emissions. This chapter discusses social efficiency (nontechnical means for reducing energy use) and stresses the social and environmental context in which energy consumption occurs in various sectors. Three important sectors for energy use, transport, buildings, and agriculture, are used to illustrate the potential for social efficiency in energy reductions.

    "[117,0,0,\"Consistent with other published studies, the modelling presented here reveals that baseload power plants are the first aspects of the electricity sector to decarbonize and are essentially decarbonized once CO2 permit prices exceed a certain threshold ($90/ton CO2 in this study). The decarbonization of baseload electricity is met by significant expansions of nuclear power and renewable energy generation technologies as well as the application of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies applied to both coal and natural gas fired power plants. Relatively little attention has been paid thus far to whether intermediate and peaking units would respond the same way to a climate policy given the very different operational and economic context that these kinds of electricity generation units operate under. In this paper, the authors discuss key aspects of the load segmentation methodology used to imbed a varying electricity demand within the GCAM (a state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Model) energy and economic modelling framework and present key results on the role CCS technologies could play in decarbonizng subpeak and peak generation (encompassing only the top 10% of the load) and under what conditions. To do this, the authors have modelled two hypothetical climate policies that require 50% and 80% reductions in US emissions from business as usual by the middle of this century. Intermediate electricity generation is virtually decarbonized once carbon prices exceed approximately $150/tonCO2. When CO2 permit prices exceed $160/tonCO2, natural gas power plants with CCS have roughly the same marketshare as conventional gas plants in serving subpeak loads. The penetration of CCS into peak load (upper 6% here) is minimal under the scenarios modeled here suggesting that CO2 emissions from this aspect of the U.S. electricity sector would persist well into the future even with stringent CO2 emission control policies in place. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

    "[119,0,0,\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change quantified a cumulative remaining carbon budget beyond which there is a high likelihood global average temperatures will increase more than 2 °C above preindustrial temperature. While there is global participation in mitigation efforts, there is little global collaboration to cooperatively mitigate emissions. Instead, countries have been acting as individual agents with independent emission reduction objectives. However, such asymmetric unilateral climate policies create the opportunity for carbon leakage resulting from the shift in embodied carbon emissions within trade networks. In this analysis, we use an optimization-based model of the global crude trade as a case study to demonstrate the importance of a cooperative, system-level approach to climate policy in order to most effectively, efficiently, and equitably achieve carbon mitigation objectives. To do this, we first characterize the cost and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 2014 crude production and consumption system by aggregating multiple data sources and developing a balanced trade matrix. We then optimize this network to demonstrate the potential for carbon mitigation through more efficient use of crude resources. Finally, we implement a global carbon cap on total annual crude emissions. We find that such a cap would require crude consumption to drop from 4.2 gigatons (Gt) to 1.1 Gt. However, if each country had an individual carbon allocation in addition to the global cap consistent with the nationally determined contribution limits resulting from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, allowable consumption would further decrease to approximately 770 million metric tonnes. Additionally, the carbon accounting method used to assign responsibility for embodied carbon emissions associated with the traded crude further influences allowable production and consumption for each country. The simplified model presented here highlights how global cooperation and a system-level cooperative approach could guide climate policy efforts to be more cost effective and equitable, while reducing the leakage potential resulting from shifting trade patterns of embodied carbon emissions. Additionally, it demonstrates how the spatial distribution of crude consumption and production patterns change under a global carbon cap given various carbon accounting strategies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\"],\n",
    "[120,0,0,\"CO2 emissions reductions from within the U.S. electricity sector can come primarily from four sources: reductions in the emissions intensity of the operating coal and natural gas fleets, shifting generation from coal to natural gas, shifting generation from fossil fuels to renewables, and reduced total generation in response to lower electricity demand. The relative importance of each of these margins depends on technology costs, fuel costs, and electricity demand growth. In this paper we explore how recent changes in actual and predicted technology costs for renewables, natural gas prices, and the rate of electricity demand growth have affected emissions from the electricity sector. We use a model to analyze how the sector would respond to a carbon tax with emphasis on the contributions of the four margins and compare with older analysis performed when technology and fuel cost projections were different. We find that a carbon tax induces a more prominent shift of generation from both coal and gas to renewables than from coal to both gas and renewables under the more recent technology and cost projections. We also show that contrary to findings from earlier analysis with higher assumed renewables costs, high natural gas prices enhance the effectiveness of CO2 taxes through greater substitution from gas to renewables. Carbon taxes are having a smaller impact on retail electricity prices in both absolute and percentage terms and thus on overall demand with the more recent projections. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

Focusing on capture systems for coal-fired power plants until 2030, a sensitivity analysis of key CCS parameters is performed to gain insight into the role that CCS can play in future mitigation scenarios and to explore implications of large-scale CCS deployment. By integrating important parameters for CCS technologies into a carbon-abatement model similar to the EPRI Prism analysis (EPRI, 2007), this study concludes that the start time and rate of technology diffusion are important in determining emissions reductions and fuel consumption for CCS technologies. Comparisons with legislative emissions targets illustrate that CCS alone is very unlikely to meet reduction targets for the electric-power sector, even under aggressive deployment scenarios. A portfolio of supply and demand-side strategies is needed to reach emissions objectives, especially in the near term. Furthermore, model results show that the breakdown of capture technologies does not have a significant influence on potential emissions reductions. However, the level of CCS retrofits at existing plants and the eligibility of CCS for new subcritical plants have large effects on the extent of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Four explanatory variables were found to be significant determinants of WTP in every model: environment, energy consumption, and climate change; concerns about climate change impacts; inability to stop climate change; and gasoline prices and consumption.

This study employs a newly developed computational tool to compare the performance and cost impacts of applying a technology-neutral CO2 emission performance standard to pulverized coal (PC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants and to evaluate the role of CO2 utilization in accelerating carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment. We explore the impacts of performance standards between 1000 and 300 lb of CO2/MWh gross, a range more stringent than the recently proposed standard by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Meeting such standards would require CO2 emission reductions of roughly 45-85% for new PC baseload plants and 0-65% for new NGCC baseload plants. Adding current amine-based CCS to meet these standards increases the plant levelized cost of electricity by 35-66% for PC plants and 0-26% for NGCC plants. On an absolute basis, meeting the most stringent standard of 300 lb/MWh gross would add $38.9/MWh to the cost of the PC plant but only $16.5/MWh for the NGCC plant. This cost advantage of NGCC plants relative to PC plants is strongly affected by plant capacity factor and natural gas price and could be diminished by gas prices above approximately $9.0/GJ for new baseload plants subject to a range of performance standards. Our analysis of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) option shows that, at a price of roughly $40/metric ton of CO2, the revenue from selling the captured CO2 for the EOR could fully offset the capture cost for PC plants. Higher CO2 prices would be required to fully pay for CO 2 capture at NGCC plants. Using the captured CO2 for EOR thus would facilitate continued coal use for low-carbon electricity generation, even under the most stringent performance standard modeled. © 2013 American Chemical Society.\"],\n",

    "[128,0,0,\"Rapidly growing energy demand from China's transportation sector in the last two decades have raised concerns over national energy security, local air pollution, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and there is broad consensus that China's transportation sector will continue to grow in the coming decades. This paper explores the future development of China's transportation sector in terms of service demands, final energy consumption, and CO2 emissions, and their interactions with global climate policy. This study develops a detailed China transportation energy model that is nested in an integrated assessment model-Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)-to evaluate the long-term energy consumption and CO2 emissions of China's transportation sector from a global perspective. The analysis suggests that, without major policy intervention, future transportation energy consumption and CO2 emissions will continue to rapidly increase and the transportation sector will remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Although carbon price policies may significantly reduce the sector's energy consumption and CO2 emissions, the associated changes in service demands and modal split will be modest, particularly in the passenger transport sector. The analysis also suggests that it is more difficult to decarbonize the transportation sector than other sectors of the economy, primarily owing to its heavy reliance on petroleum products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[129,0,0,\"Industries in Durban, South Africa, are a major source of air pollutant emissions and large users of fossil fuel based energy. Durban's energy strategy prioritises energy efficiency at industries as a key action, whilst industries are also the focus of the city's air quality management plan (AQMP). In this paper, measures that have been introduced in industries in Durban to effect air quality improvements and reduce energy consumption are examined in terms of their respective impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. It was found that co-benefits for GHG mitigation were achieved when petroleum refineries switched from using heavy fuel oil to refinery gas and methane rich gas. Within other industries, co-benefits for air quality stemmed from reducing fossil fuel energy consumption and the improved efficiency of combustion systems. Air quality and energy policies in the city are being executed independently, without consideration of the trade-offs or synergies of the interventions being implemented. Recommendations are made for authorities and industries to consider the co-benefits for GHG mitigation in their AQMPs and where these are not possible to consider offsetting the increased GHG emissions through improved alignment with energy strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

Focusing on the European Union, the article discusses the opportunities policy makers can implement to reduce the climate impacts and achieve the Paris Agreement 2050 targets. The analysis specifically looks at the fossil fuels industry and the future of the fossil sector post COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis first revises the fossil fuel sector, and then considers the need for a shift of the global climate change policy from promoting the deployment of renewable energy sources to curtailing the use of fossil fuels. This will be a change to the current global approach, from a relative passive one to a strategically dynamic and proactive one. Such a curtailment should be based on actual volumes of fossil fuels used and not on percentages. Finally, conclusions are preliminary applied to the European Union policies for net zero by 2050 based on a two-fold strategy: continuing and reinforcing the implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive to 2035, while adopting a new directive for fixed and over time increasing curtailment of fossils as of 2025 until 2050. © 2021 by the authors.

A microgrid uses an increased number of DER, and therefore it is a good model to make the traditional grid more reliable. In this context, this paper studies the current energy grid power generation arrangement to establish a feasibility baseline for future DER implementation, such as Small Hydropower Plants (SHP) in a microgrid scenario.

Both problems involve consumption of a currently beneficial product that causes detrimental effects in the distant future and for which current reductions in usage induces an adjustment cost. The paper argues that because fossil fuel control requires solving an international public goods problem as well as an addiction-like problem, breaking it will be more challenging. Using insights from the model, it also suggests that fossil fuel addiction, like cigarette addiction, may generate a long period of time in which people express sincere desire to convert to clean energy, but accomplish little to achieve that outcome. Finally the paper examines the history of the international anti-smoking campaign to draw insights for the campaign against global climate change. The analogy suggests that policies to reduce the present cost of non-carbon energy sources to induce voluntary adjustments in energy usage, or, policies that induce cleaner usage of fossil fuels, or geo-engineering policies that work to reverse the warming effects of higher CO2 concentrations, may be more viable than policies that raise the cost of current fossil fuel consumption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

It proceeds to forecast the trend of renewable energy fifteen years after the sample period. The results, based on the application of the Vector Error Correction Model and Johansen cointegration technique, on a dataset covering 1980 to 2015, shows that Ghana's renewable electricity is mainly driven by foreign direct investment and trade openness, with real GDP per capita being inconsequential. What's more, both financial development and fossil fuel consumption undermine renewable energy development in Ghana. The dynamic forecast reveals an uninspiring future for renewable electricity, as generation will continue to plummet if conditions remain the same.

The intensity of sourcing and use of these renewable natural resources in these countries are increasing owing to multifarious reasons. Series of reported studies and experiences have shown that this trend is not likely to reverse in the nearest future in these countries and that there is also very likely to be an upward global surge in this regard perhaps because of the expected positive responses to the increasing campaign for gradual energy switch to biofuels partly in order to contribute to the series of efforts at controlling the presently experienced global climate change as a result of fossil fuel combustion on one hand and finiteness of this non-renewable resource (fossil fuel) on the other. In line with these concerns, some developed countries are already increasing biofuels in their energy supplies, main source of which are expected to likely be from less developed tropical countries in future with series of projections concerning this. Therefore, there is the need for sustainable means of producing biomass for this purpose in these developing countries coupled with strategies that will capture future possibilities of supplying this resource to other parts of the world when the demand arise. However, literature showed that irrespective of the increasing importance of biofuels, the present awareness levels concerning this and investment in renewable energy technologies are still low, noting that most of the efforts in these regard appear to be more in the developed countries.

Already, about 40 nations have implemented explicit or implicit carbon prices, and a carbon price was explicitly stated as a mitigation strategy by many nations in their emission pledges submitted to the Paris Agreement. The coverage of carbon prices varies significantly between nations though, often only covering a subset of sectors in the economy. We investigate the propagation of carbon prices along the global supply-chain when the carbon price is applied at the point where carbon is removed from the ground (extraction), is combusted (production), or where goods and services are consumed (consumption). We consider both the regional and sectoral effects, and compare the carbon price income and costs relative to economic output. We find that implementation using different accounting systems makes a significant difference to revenues and increased expenditure, and that domestic and global trade plays a significant role in spreading the carbon price between sectors and countries. A few single sectors experience the largest relative price increases (especially electricity and transport), but most of the carbon price is ultimately paid by households for goods and services due to the large expenditure and indirect supply chain impacts. We finally show that a global carbon price will generate a larger share of revenue relative to GDP in non-OECD nations than OECD nations, independent on the point of implementation. © 2018 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, an over-subsidisation and poor implementation may lead these subsidies to deviate from their initial objectives or even contradict them. This paper uses the price-gap approach to estimate the size of energy subsidies in Saudi Arabia. The results indicate that the value of kingdom's energy subsidies amounts for $80 billion in 2012, representing 11% of the country's GDP. Oil products, gasoline and diesel, are the most subsidised followed by electricity and finally natural gas. The Input-output model was used to quantify the effect of a reform on the economy. The findings show that a total removal of energy subsidies with no social safety nets would affect negatively Saudi Arabia's economy and mostly the energy intensive industries, especially the quarrying and mining sector. However, a total removal of subsidies accompanied with a targeted cash transfer towards social and health sectors would affect positively the majority of the country's economy apart from sectors that relays heavily on energy consumption.

    "[142,0,0,\"The problem of massive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels and their climatic impact have become major scientific and political issues. Future stabilization of the atmospheric CO2 content requires a drastic decrease of CO2 emissions worldwide. Energy savings and carbon sequestration, including CO2 capture/storage and enhancement of natural carbon sinks, can be highly beneficial, although it is suggested that both economic and climatic feedbacks could nullify part of the gains achieved. Fossil fuels (coupled with CO2 capture), and lower-carbon hydrogenated fuels such as natural gas are still expected to play an important role in the future. Nevertheless, stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration in a growing world economy, now dependent on fossil fuels for 85% of its energy, will also require a vast increase in the supply of carbon-free power. Among these energy sources, hydropower and nuclear energy (operated under western safety and environmental standards) are the most readily available sources capable of supplying vast amount of energy at a competitive price. Wind power is also to be encouraged, as it is expected to approach the competitiveness threshold soon. The French example, where fossil fuel CO2 emissions were cut by 27% in a matter of a few years (1979-1986) despite increasing energy consumption, suggests that implementing CO2 stabilization is technically feasible at a competitive price. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The results show that the price elasticity of demand for all fossil fuels is low, but the respective income elasticity is higher. Therefore, an increase in the general price level caused by the subsidy reform will lead to the erosion of real income and will have related welfare implications in India. The results also reveal that energy expenditure will obviously increase and hence energy consumption will decline depending upon the extent of the withdrawal of subsidy. Therefore, policy makers in India, while undertaking further reforms, must ensure that the subsidy reaches to those who truly deserve, so that the socioeconomic casualty of reforms can be minimized along with achieving fiscal goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[145,0,0,\"The continuing dependence of the global economy on fossil fuels is worrying because it imposes limits on growth due to the non-renewable nature of these resources and also contributes to global climate change. Resource optimists believe that this is no reason to worry, because the economy will always find a way to overcome these constraints. Their arguments, however, require that resource prices reflect the scarcity of non-renewable resources, which implies that they must obey the Hotelling rule . Empirical analyses, however, show that the Hotelling rule does not hold in reality, which raises the question: does the failure of the Hotelling rule imply that social optimality is not achieved? This paper argues that the answer depends on the reason for the failure. If extraction and exploration costs, or technological progress in these activities, are the reasons for the failure, a market failure is not implied, and optimality may still be achieved. But if the Hotelling rule fails due to uncertain property rights or strategic interaction, the market will surely fail to provide an optimal solution.

Such systems require much less biomass to make low-carbon fuels than do biofuels processes. The economics are especially attractive when these coproduction systems are deployed as alternatives to CCS for stand-alone fossil fuel power plants.

We forecast field-specific costs for exploration, development and production through constructing functions for the number of wells drilled and producing wells, production and economic limits. Various scenarios of phasing out producer subsidies in U.S. federal and state regulation on optimal production using field data from the Gulf of Mexico are simulated, including removing royalty relief, amortization of geological and geophysical costs, and percentage depletion. The results show that removal of producer subsidies reduces the optimal production rate and investors’ net present value and increases government revenue, but the total effect is a cost of net social benefits. Changes in both the discount rate and oil price have positive effects on optimal production, but they exert opposite effects on producer benefits.

Emission from cement production is projected on the basis of the forecast of cement output, which is deemed to be relative to urbanization process, while the latter follows the traditional S-curve development law. The estimation of forest carbon sink capability, involving the existing and newly afforested one, is conducted by employing the C02FIX model.

Our results indicate that carbon emission from energy consumption peaks in 2031, with an emission of 2637 MtC (Million tons of Carbon equivalent) and the GDP per capita in that year is lower than the empirical experience of OECD countries; while the per capita energy-induced emission peaks in 2030, with a volume of 1.73 tC, which is far behind the US level of 2006 and still lower than the EU and Japan level of 2006. Besides, emission from cement production demonstrates a slow-down growth trend, and its emission is confined within 254 MtC, which is equivalently 12% of gross emission (here it refers to those emitted from energy consumption and cement production).

Average global oil prices have plunged from USD 110 per barrel in June 2014 to approximately USD 60 per barrel in May 2015.

We do so through a general equilibrium model in which Peak Oil endogenously emerges from the interplay between the geological, technical, macroeconomic and geopolitical determinants of supply and demand under non-perfect expectations. We analyze the macroeconomic effects of oil production profiles and demonstrate that Peak Oil dates that differ only slightly may lead to very different time profiles of oil prices, exportation flows and economic activity. We investigate Middle-East's trade-off between different pricing trajectories in function of two alternative objectives (maximisation of oil revenues or households' welfare) and assess its impact on OECD growth trajectories. A sensitivity analysis highlights the respective roles of the amount of resources, inertia on the deployment of non conventional oil and short-term oil price dynamics on Peak Oil dates and long-term oil prices. It also examines the effects of these assumptions on OECD growth and Middle-East strategic tradeoffs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[158,0,0,\"Optimizing the coal-dominated structure of energy consumption would effectively contribute toward ensuring that China's carbon emissions peak by 2030. To investigate whether this goal can be achieved through such optimization, the present study proposed a new economic-carbon emission-costs (ECC) multi-objective optimization model. Our findings show that the carbon emission peak will be achieved between 2025 and 2028, most likely in 2028, with 10.12 billion tonnes CO2. The peak of coal consumption was achieved in 2013 whereas the oil consumption cannot be peaked before 2035 in the GDP preference. In the process, China's GDP will be able to maintain an average annual growth rate of 5.9%–6.3% between 2017 and 2030, while the carbon emission average annual growth will be 0.5%–1.1%. The carbon intensity in 2030 can drop to 71.9% based on the 2005 level, which would exceed the committed reduction goal of carbon intensity equal to 60–65%. Furthermore, we find that the volume and time of the CO2 emission peak are not sensitive to renewable electricity price, but are sensitive to the assumptions both the minimum average annual growth rates of GDP and the average annual reduction rate of energy intensity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

In that context, we discuss the relationship between mitigation potential and scenario characteristics, and how these interact with policy measures that increase the effective price of fuel, for example, ICAO’s CORSIA emissions offset scheme. We find that global fuel lifecycle CO2 emissions per revenue passenger km could be reduced by 1.9% to 3.0% per year on average by the use of a combination of cost-effective measures, for oil prices which reach $75 to $185 per barrel by 2050. Smaller additional emissions reductions, of the order of 0.1% per year, are possible if carbon prices of $50 to $150/tCO2 are assumed by 2050. These outcomes strongly depend on assumptions about biofuels, which account for about half of the reduction potential by 2050.

    "[161,0,0,\"Climate change threatens all parts of the US electric power system, from electricity generation to distribution. An important dimension of this issue is the impact on electricity demand. While many studies have looked at these impacts, few have tried to represent this effect at higher temporal resolutions (such as daily or sub-daily) or to analyze its seasonal aspects. Our study expands on previous work to improve our understanding of how climate change can affect patterns of hourly electricity demand, the differences in these effects over different seasons, and how this in turn could affect the operations of the power system. For this analysis, we combine a linear regression model, a simplified economic dispatch model, and projections from twenty different climate models to analyze how climate change may affect seasonal demand patterns and, consequently, power plants dispatch. We use this method to analyze a case study of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The results suggest that climate change can result in an average increase in annual electricity consumption in the TVA region of 6% by the end of the century and an increase in the frequency of peak demand values (the maximum quantity of electricity demanded during an hour). However, this increase is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. During summer, total electricity consumption can increase on average by 20% while during winter, it may decrease on average by 6% by the end of the century. Such changes in demand could result in changes in the typical dispatch patterns of TVA’s power plants. Estimated summer time capacity factors would increase (8 to 37% for natural gas and 71 to 84% for coal) and winter time capacity factor decrease (3% to virtually zero for natural gas and 67 to 60% for coal).

    "[162,0,0,\"Energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for current landfilling of municipal solid waste (MSW) was compared to potential biodegradation of MSW in anaerobic digesters (AD) throughout the United States. A hybrid life-cycle analysis was completed to assess the potential for anaerobic biodegradation of MSW to methane, a valuable energy source. Conversion of MSW to methane in AD would generate a form of renewable energy, reduce GHG emissions, and save landfill space for nonbiodegradable materials. Based on laboratory- and pilot-scale studies conducted in the United States, full-scale data from facilities in Europe, and economic input-output life-cycle analysis, the annual 127 million t of MSW landfilled in the United States could be biologically converted to 5.9 billion m3 of methane. Net methane production would have an estimated value of $1.5 billion/year when converted to an equivalent amount of electricity at an assumed value of $0.1/kWh. The 15 billion kWh/year of renewable energy released through the biodegradation process is estimated to satisfy the annual consumption of 1.3 million United States households. The analysis also suggests that diversion of MSW from landfills to AD systems would result in GHG emissions reductions of 146 million t CO2 e per year, due to decreased landfill activity and use of biogenic methane instead of fossil fuel for electricity production. This represents a reduction in total emissions of 1.9% compared to U.S. GHG emissions in 2006. Nationwide AD systems are projected to reduce cumulative energy consumption by nearly 15 million TJ and reduce GHG emissions by 7.2 billion t CO2 e, over a 50-year period. Logistics and capital costs of developing a nationwide reactor-based system for MSW management are considerable. Development of appropriate national policy and incentives would be needed to stimulate such a transition from the current landfill-based system that currently exists. It is estimated that a carbon emissions credit on the order of $30 to $60/t CO2 e would facilitate break-even economics for nationwide implementation of AD systems. Alternatively, renewable energy credits would enhance the value of electricity produced from AD biogas. Carbon emissions taxes on landfills would further improve the economics of AD systems. © 2009 ASCE.\"],\n",

Despite high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, residential electricity consumption continues to increase in the United States and fossil fuels are the primary fuel source of electricity generation. 97.2% of the variability in carbon emissions in the electricity industry was explained by electricity generation from coal and residential electricity consumption. The relationships between residential electricity consumption, short-term climatic variability, long-term climatic trends, short-term reduction in electricity from EE programs, and long-term trends in EE programs was examined. This is the first study of its nature to examine these relationships across the 48 contiguous United States. Inter-year and long-term trends in cooling degree days, or days above a baseline temperature, were the primary climatic drivers of residential electricity consumption. Cooling degree days increased across the majority of the United States during the study period, and shared a positive relationship with residential electricity consumption when findings were significant. The majority of electricity reduction from EE programs was negatively related to residential electricity consumption where findings were significant. However, the trend across the majority of states was a decrease in electricity reduction from EE while residential electricity consumption increased. States that successfully reduced consumption are discussed, in addition to the potential use of communication theory to design interventions aimed at improving EE program success. © 2016\"],\n",

    "[165,0,0,\"Globally, crop straw is a rich resource and further establishment of its use as an energy source is an important aspect in developing the circular economy. Projects in this vein can bring benefits such as improving energy access and living conditions as well as boosting the local economy and employment opportunities in rural communities. This paper presents a detailed case study on the production of bio-natural gas (BNG) from corn straw in China, using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to assess energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, conducting economic analysis, and analyzing operation management models. The “Nongbaomu” business model (whereby professional personnel assist farmers in the management of straw collection, bundling, storage and transportation) and the “Mutual Offsetting in Kind” business model (whereby farmers can buy a quota of the project's BNG products at a lower price in return for selling straw to the project) can ensure the acquisition of straw by the BNG project at stable prices and high quality. Because the main product (BNG) replaces refined oil products used by automobiles and the byproduct (organic fertilizer) replaces traditional fertilizer (produced using coal), the project offers the potential for significant decreases (up to 80%) in life cycle GHG emissions and fossil fuel use. Benefited from the relatively high natural gas prices in the project location and applicable government subsidies, our studied case was found to be economically viable. The findings in this study are also likely to be relevant to other countries where governments should develop industrial policies that support the development of rural distributed energy, and introduce and implement appropriate subsidies to allow BNG to compete in the traditional natural gas market. Although, enterprises are responsible for selecting an effective business models and the most appropriate technological pathway, governments should also identify the ways in which they can support businesses to make these choices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse.

Existing studies employ a broad range of assumptions and lack a consistent costing method. This study takes a more systematic approach to analyze plants with an amine-based postcombustion CCS system with 90% CO2 capture. We employ sensitivity analyses together with a probabilistic analysis to quantify costs for plants with and without CCS under uncertainty or variability in key parameters. Results for new baseload plants indicate a likely increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $20-32/MWh (constant 2007$) or $22-40/MWh in current dollars. A risk premium for plants with CCS increases these ranges to $23-39/MWh and $25-46/MWh, respectively. Based on current cost estimates, our analysis further shows that a policy to encourage CCS at new NGCC plants via an emission tax or carbon price requires (at 95% confidence) a price of at least $125/t CO2 to ensure NGCC-CCS is cheaper than a plant without CCS. Higher costs are found for nonbaseload plants and CCS retrofits. © 2012 American Chemical Society.\"],\n",

Using data on 93 million individual households, we estimate these GHGs across the contiguous United States and clarify the respective influence of climate, affluence, energy infrastructure, urban form, and building attributes (age, housing type, heating fuel) in driving these emissions. A ranking by state reveals that GHGs (per unit floor space) are lowest in Western US states and highest in Central states. Wealthier Americans have per capita footprints ?25% higher than those of lower-income residents, primarily due to larger homes. In especially affluent suburbs, these emissions can be 15 times higher than nearby neighborhoods. If the electrical grid is decarbonized, then the residential housing sector can meet the 28% emission reduction target for 2025 under the Paris Agreement. However, grid decarbonization will be insufficient to meet the 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 due to a growing housing stock and continued use of fossil fuels (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil) in homes. Meeting this target will also require deep energy retrofits and transitioning to distributed low-carbon energy sources, as well as reducing per capita floor space and zoning denser settlement patterns. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Understanding the domestic demand of oil producing countries is important due to the existence of subsidised supply, loss of foreign exchange income and the environmental effects of oil use. The paper analyses the evolution of petroleum product demand in MENA and presents an econometric analysis of demand using a simple log-linear specification for four petroleum products, namely gasoline, diesel, kerosene and fuel oil. The study covers seven MENA countries, namely Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. The results show that demand has grown quite fast in these countries probably because the fuel price has been kept very low while income has risen fast and thus demand has grown fast. The gasoline demand model has performed better than other models in terms of producing expected signs for the parameters. The results for the kerosene model was the least satisfactory as most of the coefficients were found to be statistically insignificant.

Expectations for a rapidly growing economy in the next decade will likely cause an increase in the fraction of energy consumed domestically limiting what is available for export. These challenges are the biggest for resource-rich countries, since their economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports alongside an energy-intensive economy. Thus, the paper addresses the question of how the development of energy systems among resource-rich countries has changed over the past three decades and what role can they play in the sustainable development of the region's energy system and emission reduction goals? To address this question, we present an overview on energy trends in four resource-rich countries in the Middle East, which nearly account for 76% of the region's energy-related emissions and about 77% of total energy consumption. These countries are namely, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. Accordingly, we present a comparative energy analysis between the four countries through examining historical and current energy trends, the structure of energy supply, the status of renewable deployment and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Results from the analysis showed that inefficient energy production and consumption have played a role in the deterioration of the energy landscape of the four countries compared to the global energy system. Thus, this highlights the necessity for suitable energy strategies and effective policies that will be central to sustainable energy development.

Its first commercial uses dates back to the early 1800's and has continued to grow throughout the years. One of its most known and common uses is at a small scale as a heat source for residences. It can also be used at a much larger scales. There are several questions that come up with large scale geothermal energy model. How much energy can be produced?

Are there limitations in regards to geographic locations? This paper will identify and explore the viability of different large-scale uses of geothermal energy, and how it stands out in comparison to other major sources of renewable energy such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and bio energy. The results of this study indicates initial costs of geothermal power plants is high, even double compared to other power generation plants, due to the high cost of well drilling and well exploration. However, the lifecycle costs of geothermal plants tend to be much lower, resulting in a sound economic choice over the lifespan of a facility.

    "[179,0,0,\"Limited supply of nonrenewable energy resources under growing energy demand creates a situation when a marginal change in the quantity supplied or demanded causes non-marginal swings in price levels. The situation is worsened by the fact that we are currently running out of cheap energy resources at the global scale while adaptation to climate change requires extra energy costs. It is often argued that technology and alternative energy will be a solution. However, alternative energy infrastructure also requires additional energy investments, which can further increase the gap between energy demand and supply. This paper presents an explorative model that demonstrates that a smooth transition from an oil-based economy to alternative energy sources is possible only if it is started well in advance while fossil resources are still abundant. Later the transition looks much more dramatic and it becomes risky to rely entirely on technological solutions. It becomes increasingly likely that in addition to technological solutions that can increase supply we will need to find ways to decrease demand and consumption. We further argue that market mechanisms can be just as powerful tools to curb demand as they have traditionally been for stimulating consumption. We observe that individuals who consume more energy resources benefit at the expense of those who consume less, effectively imposing price externalities on the latters. We suggest two transparent and flexible methods of pricing that attempt to eliminate price externalities on energy resources. Such pricing schemes stimulate less consumption and can smooth the transition to renewable energy. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"],\n",

    "[186,0,0,\"Perhaps the most tactile source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stem from vehicle-use. Because consumers are well aware of their price and quantity decisions it is likely that consumer demand for CO2 emissions from motor-gasoline are quite responsive to the overall state of the economy. Using a structurally identified Markov-switching demand model I find that CO2 emissions respond asymmetrically to changes in income and the price of gasoline in expansionary and contracting states of the economy. The findings of this paper indicate that flexible policy instruments have the potential to mitigate undue burden on consumers and producers compared to their static counterparts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",
    "[187,0,0,\"A model is presented in this work for simulating endogenously the evolution of the marginal costs of production of energy carriers from non-renewable resources, their consumption, depletion pathways and timescales. Such marginal costs can be used to simulate the long term average price formation of energy commodities. Drawing on previous work where a global database of energy resource economic potentials was constructed, this work uses cost distributions of non-renewable resources in order to evaluate global flows of energy commodities. A mathematical framework is given to calculate endogenous flows of energy resources given an exogenous commodity price path. This framework can be used in reverse in order to calculate an endogenous marginal cost of production of energy carriers given an exogenous carrier demand. Using rigid price inelastic assumptions independent of the economy, these two approaches generate limiting scenarios that depict extreme use of natural resources. This is useful to characterise the current state and possible uses of remaining non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels and natural uranium. The theory is however designed for use within economic or technology models that allow technology substitutions. In this work, it is implemented in the global power sector model FTT:Power. Policy implications are given. © 2013 The Authors.\"],\n",
    "[188,0,0,\"This paper analyzes the long-term and short-term effects of oil prices on ethanol, gasoline, and sugar price forecasts. With the help of a vector error correction with exogenous variable (VECX) model, and using the forecast of oil prices as an exogenous variable, we obtained simultaneous forecasts for sugar, gasoline, and sugar prices. Due to the lack of a robust methodology for forecasting oil prices, we forecasted three scenarios that took the historical behavior of oil prices into account, and a fourth scenario that took into account the prediction of a prominent agency that specializes in forecasting commodity prices. The forecast period was from January 2019 to December 2022. The results indicate that: (i) there are long-term effects of the oil price forecast on the forecasts of the other three prices; (ii) in the short term, the ethanol and gasoline price forecasts were more sensitive to changes in future oil prices than the sugar price forecast; and (iii) the future volatility of the price of sugar is less than the future volatility of the other two prices. These results can assist agents in the sugarcane and energy sectors when making strategic decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[189,0,0,\"Since the beginning of the last century, energy affairs have always been taken into global consideration due to their effects on economies, policies, security and the environment. Fossil fuels have been the first recourse for global energy supply needs (80% of total energy consumption); nonetheless, owing to the production of greenhouse gases, they are gradually being replaced with renewable energy resources. In addition, renewable energy resources are perpetual, unlike fossil fuels, which may be exhausted in less than one century. From 2005 to 2010 (coinciding with Iran's fourth development program), renewable energy resources enjoyed a double-digit global growth rate as a result of environmentally friendly perception and a reduction in equipment price. Some policies and strategies were globally adopted to support renewable energy resources (Feed-In-Tariff, subsidies, etc.). Iran began utilizing renewable resources from the early 1990s and set targets and policies for renewable energy resource utilization in the fourth development program. However, Iran's trend has not aligned with global trends, and it appears that its enormous fossil fuel reserves overshadow the growth of renewable energy resources in the country. In this paper, the status, achievements and policies of Iran during the fourth development program will be discussed and compared with global trends. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[190,0,0,\"Chemical production is set to become the single largest driver of global oil consumption by 2030. To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO2-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps. Once and where these other demands are satisfied, CCU in the chemical industry could efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

It also presents in detail how to implement a thermal model predictive controller (MPC) for the heaters' power consumption prediction in the PowerFlexHouse. It demonstrates that this MPC strategy can realize load shifting, and using good predictions in MPC-based control, a better matching of demand and supply can be achieved. With this demand side control study, it is expected that MPC strategy for active load management can dramatically raise energy efficiency and improve grid reliability, when there is a high penetration of intermittent energy resources in the power system. © 2012 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[193,0,0,\"Using the two criteria of potential CO2 reduction and cost of CO2 reduction, technical energy measures in Swedish pulp and paper mills are investigated. Principal CO2-reducing measures analysed are: decreased specific energy utilisation, fuel switch, and CO2 capture and sequestration. Among the investigated measures, conventional technologies for electricity conservation and improved electrical conversion efficiency in existing systems for cogeneration of heat and power are identified as the most cost-effective alternatives that also have large CO2 reduction potentials. For commercially available technologies, the results indicate an accumulated reduction potential of up to 8 MtCO2/y (14% of the Swedish net emissions). If emerging technologies for black liquor gasification (BLG) with pre-combustion CO2 capture and sequestration are considered, the CO2 reduction potential increases by up to 6 MtCO2/y (10% of the Swedish net emissions). Commercialised BLG, CO2 capture and reliable CO2 sequestration technologies are identified as important potential contributors to Swedish compliance with Kyoto Protocol targets, especially in a scenario of nuclear power closure. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "[194,0,0,\"Energy data are often reported on an annual basis. To address the climate and health impacts of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, seasonally resolved emissions inventories are needed. The seasonality of energy consumption is most affected by consumption in the residential sector. In this study, a set of regression models were developed based on temperature-related variables and a series of socioeconomic parameters to quantify global electricity and fuel consumption for the residential sector. The models were evaluated against observations and applied to simulate monthly changes in residential energy consumption and the resultant emissions of air pollutants. Changes in energy consumption are strongly affected by economic prosperity and population growth. Climate change, electricity prices, and urbanization also affect energy use. Climate warming will cause a net increase in electricity consumption and a decrease in fuel consumption by the residential sector. Consequently, emissions of CO2, SO2, and Hg are predicted to decrease, while emissions of incomplete combustion products are expected to increase. These changes vary regionally. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[195,0,0,\"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions forecasting is becoming more important due to increasing climatic problems, which contributes to developing scientific climate policies and making reasonable energy plans. Considering that the influential factors of CO2 emissions are multiplex and the relationships between factors and CO2 emissions are complex and non-linear, a novel CO2 forecasting model called SSA-LSSVM, which utilizes the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) to optimize the two parameters of the least squares support sector machine (LSSVM) model, is proposed in this paper. The influential factors of CO2 emissions, including the gross domestic product (GDP), population, energy consumption, economic structure, energy structure, urbanization rate, and energy intensity, are regarded as the input variables of the SSA-LSSVM model. The proposed model is verified to show a better forecasting performance compared with the selected models, including the single LSSVM model, the LSSVM model optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-LSSVM), and the back propagation (BP) neural network model, on CO2 emissions in China from 2014 to 2016. The comparative analysis indicates the SSA-LSSVM model is greatly superior and has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of CO2 emissions forecasting. CO2 emissions in China from 2017 to 2020 are forecast combined with the 13th Five-Year Plan for social, economic and energy development. The comparison of CO2 emissions of China in 2020 shows that structural factors significantly affect CO2 emission forecasting results. The average annual growth of CO2 emissions slows down significantly due to a series of policies and actions taken by the Chinese government, which means China can keep the promise that greenhouse gas emissions will start to drop after 2030. © 2018 by the authors.\"],\n",
    "[196,0,0,\"Cement is a primary component of concrete and is consumed extensively for construction and transportation infrastructures worldwide. Cement is largely produced and consumed locally but has global impact in terms of both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. China is both the largest producer of cement and the biggest emitter of CO2 emissions in the world. It has been widely recognized that uncertainties of Chinas CO2 emissions were poorly quantified and clear discrepancies can be identified among different sources. These discrepancies arise from many uncertainties, including system boundary and statistical standards, availability of production data (especially for the clinker and cement outputs), and emission factors. We argue that the emission factors (EFs, either default values or adjusted ones) are the most important here and highlight the importance of clearly defining the CO 2 accounting and reporting boundaries for determining the emission factors. We therefore developed a factory-level measurement for different types of clinker and cement production, primarily using onsite surveys and sampling, with the objective of distinguishing process-, combustion- and electricity-related emission factors on a factory level. It is a bottom-up CO2 emission inventory for China using the uniform formula and calculators and the first time factory-level sampling method (BFSM) based on three tiers of production lines, provincial and national integrations. Our results indicate that Chinas carbon emissions from cement production might be overestimated in the previous estimates because they overlooked the technology transition from the wet process to the dry process, differences in lime content and clinker-to-cement ratios, raw materials and fuels substitutions, and usages of blend additives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[197,0,0,\"Decades ago, prospects seemed strong for significantly expanded global coal consumption. Studies of energy futures depicted the full geologic extent of coal as a virtually unlimited backstop energy supply, drawing justification from legacy ratios of reserves-to-production (R-P) on the order of several centuries. Annual consumption and market prices for hard coal have doubled since 1990, providing an opportunity to recalibrate the next century's reference case with an empirically constrained outlook for this important industrial fuel source. Over the last two decades, improving knowledge of world coal deposits refined estimates of their recoverable portion, reducing assessed reserves by two-thirds. Coal supply costs during this period increased much faster than anticipated by models which mapped total geologic occurrences with long and flat supply curves. Consequently, underlying assumptions no longer hold for many multi-decade global energy reference cases depicting a rapid expansion of coal production – the conceptual framework for these scenarios needs revision. Energy system outlooks underlying pathways of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide a case study, since the climate change research community commonly uses business-as-usual scenarios with a strong carbon signal from coal combustion many times higher than current reserve estimates. In this paper, we explain why vast expansion in 21st-century coal consumption should not be used to describe any plausible reference case of the global energy future. Illustrating coal as a practically unlimited backstop supply is inconsistent with the current state of coal markets, technology, and reserve estimates. Future coal production faces many uncertainties, but the key uncertainty for long-term scenarios is the recoverable portion of reserves, not how many total geologic resources will eventually become reserves. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",
    "[198,0,0,\"This study develops a reduced-order power plant dispatch model and uses it to simulate marginal emissions factors (MEFs) for the 2014-2017 United States (U.S.) electric grid at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regional level. MEFs help quantify the health, environmental, and climate change impacts caused by changes in marginal net electricity consumption, which could result, for example, from new technologies or policies. This study develops the model, validates it against historical data, and compares its simulated MEFs against historically derived regression-based MEFs. Our method accurately reproduces CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions for multiple U.S. NERC regions and years and enables us to analyze future scenarios that are absent from the historical data. Though historically derived regression-based MEFs are generally more accurate, our simulated MEFs provide a more nuanced picture of how clusters of low- or high-emitting power plants of similar production cost create large swings in MEFs throughout the day. Policymakers could use these dynamic MEFs to target demand-reduction strategies at high-emissions portions of the power plant merit order. © 2019 American Chemical Society.\"],\n",
    "[199,0,0,\"Fossil fuels (petroleum oil, natural gas) are the only type of fuel used for electric power generation to desalt seawater in Kuwait, Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), and all Arab countries. The main constituents of fossil fuel are carbon (C) and hydrogen (H2) besides small portions of impurities such as sulphur (S), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), water moisture and particulate matters (ashes). When the fossil fuel is combusted (i.e. reacted with the oxygen in the air to generate heat), the produced gases include mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapour, carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NO). The CO, SO2 and NO gases pollute the air and are harmful to human health and the environment. CO2 is the main component of the greenhouse gases (GHG) which cause global warming. The emission of CO2, CO and NO gases from power plants to the environment creates great international concern. The basics of the environmental issues related to fossil fuel combustion and its released gases are outlined in this paper. The emitted gases due to fuel combustion to produce electric power and distilled water in Kuwait and some Arab and other countries are calculated.
