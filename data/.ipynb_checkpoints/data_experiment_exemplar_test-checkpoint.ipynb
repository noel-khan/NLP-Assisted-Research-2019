    "[1   \t,1,0,\"125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner. The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations. The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

    "[2   \t,0,0,\"3D path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles in search and rescue scenarios is an important research area, due to the ability to explore damage areas that could be inaccessible for vehicles like ground robots. This paper presents two innovative real-time path planning algorithms based on PRM (Probabilistic Road Map) able to be implemented in UAV’s denoted by Grid Path Planning Roadmap Planning (GPRM) and the Particle Probabilistic Roadmap (PPRM). With the requirement of being implemented in a real search and rescue scenario like the EuRathlon competition, the GPRM method will produce a roadmap building step with obstacles inside a predefined grid while PPRM will follow a different approach by introducing an associated probability to each computed path in order to support the next sampling step path planning iteration.

    "[3   \t,0,0,\"A Hopfield-type neural networks (HNN) algorithm associated with histogram navigation method is proposed in this paper for real-time map building and path planning for multiple goals applications. In real world applications such as rescue robots, service robots, mining mobile robots, and mine searching robots, etc., an autonomous vehicle needs to reach multiple goals with a shortest path that, in this paper, is capable of being implemented by a HNN method with minimized overall distance. Once a global trajectory is planned, a foraging-enabled trail is created to guide the vehicle to the multiple goals. A histogram-based local navigation algorithm is employed to plan a collision-free path along the trail planned by the global path planner. A re-planning-based algorithm aims to generate trajectory while an autonomous vehicle explores through a terrain with map building in unknown environments.

    "[5   \t,0,0,\"A Wireless Sensor Network consists of several simple sensor nodes deployed in an environment having as primary goal data acquisition. However, due to limited sensor communication range, oftentimes it is necessary to use a mobile sink node that will visit sensor nodes to gather up their collected data. An important aspect that must be taken into account in this case are the intrinsic limitations of the vehicle used, such as kinematic and dynamic constraints, since most of the vehicles present in our everyday life have such restrictions. Therefore, this work addresses the problem of planning efficient paths, which are length and time of collection optimized for data gathering by a mobile robot with bounded curvature. We propose the use of the classical NSGA-II in order to tackle both objective functions. The methodology was evaluated through several experiments in a simulated environment.

    "[6   \t,0,0,\"A centralized multi-AGV motion planning method is proposed. In contrast to the prevalent planners with decentralized (decoupled) formulations, a centralized planner contains no priority assignment, decoupling, or other specification strategies, thus is free from being case-dependent and deadlock-involved. Although centralized motion planning is computationally expensive, it deserves investigations in schemes that are sensitive to solution quality but insensitive to computation time. Specifically, centralized multi-AGV motion planning is formulated as an optimal control problem in this work, wherein differential algebraic equations are used to describe the AGV dynamics, mechanical restrictions, and exterior constraints. Orthogonal collocation direct transcription method is adopted to discretize the original infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a large-scale nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, which is solved using interior point method thereafter. Exhaustive simulations are conducted on 10-AGV formation reconfiguration tasks. Simulation results show the validation, unification, and real-time implementation potential of the introduced centralized planner. Particularly, the computation time on a PC reduces to several seconds with near-optimal initial guess in the NLP solving process, making receding horizon replanning possible via this centralized planner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",
    "[7   \t,0,0,\"A coherent way to enhance the user acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AV) is to ensure maximum ride comfort along the driven route. This paper proposes a sub-microscopic simulation framework that can be utilized to assess the ride comfort based on data from vehicle dynamics. In a future connected vehicle environment, this work can be used to enable an optimized route and motion planning, by avoiding sections with poor ride comfort and/or adapting the driving style and behavior. The developed methodology proposes a process chain for producing accurate and representative comfort estimates, by utilizing a road surface model, a non-linear model optimization, and Monte Carlo simulations. A case study with three real road sites demonstrates the effective tuning of the framework with real data and achieves high-resolution comfort results.

    "[8   \t,1,1,\"A collision-free trajectory planner for a car-like mobile robot moving in complex environments is introduced and the influence of the coefficient of friction on important working parameters is analyzed. The proposed planner takes into account not only the dynamic capabilities of the robot but also the behaviour of the tire. This planner is based on sequential quadratic programming algorithms and the normalized time method. Different values for the coefficient of friction have been taken following a normal Gaussian distribution to see its influence on the working parameters. The algorithm has been applied to several examples and the results show that computation times are compatible with real-time work, so the authors call them efficient generated trajectories as they avoid collisions. Besides, working parameters such as the minimum trajectory time, the maximum vehicle speed, computational time, and consumed energy have been monitored and some conclusions have been reached. © 2017 Francisco Valero et al.\"],\n",
    "[9   \t,0,0,\"A common approach used for planning blind intersection crossings is to assume that hypothetical vehicles are approaching the intersection at a constant speed from the occluded areas. Such an assumption can result in a deadlock problem, causing the ego vehicle to remain stopped at an intersection indefinitely due to insufficient visibility. To solve this problem and facilitate safe, deadlock-free intersection crossing, we propose a blind intersection planner that utilizes both the ego vehicle and the approaching vehicle’s visibility. The planner uses a particle filter and our proposed visibility-dependent behavior model of approaching vehicles for predicting hidden vehicles. The behavior model is designed based on an analysis of actual driving data from multiple drivers crossing blind intersections. The proposed planner was tested in a simulation and found to be effective for allowing deadlock-free crossings at intersections where a baseline planner became stuck in a deadlock. The effects of perception accuracy and sensor position on output motion were also investigated. It was found that the proposed planner delayed crossing motion when the perception was imperfect. Furthermore, our results showed that the planner decelerated less while crossing the intersection with the front-mounted sensor configuration compared to the roof-mounted configuration due to the improved visibility. The minimum speed difference between the two sensor configurations was 1.82 m/s at an intersection with relatively poor visibility and 1.50 m/s at an intersection with good visibility. © 2021 by the authors.

    "[10  \t,0,0,\"A common challenge for autonomous mobile ground robots in unstructured environments is the traversal of obstacles without risking to tip over. Previous research on prevention of vehicle tip-over is mostly limited to basic mobility systems with only few degrees of freedom (DOF). In this paper, a novel whole-body motion planning approach is presented. Based on a 3D world model and a given planned path, the trajectories of all joints are optimized to maximize robot stability. The resulting motion plan allows the robot to cross obstacles without tipping over. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed approach considers environment- and self-collisions during planning. Few assumptions about the robot configuration are made which enables the adoption to different mobile platforms. This approach is evaluated for a simulated and a real robot. The platform is a tracked vehicle with adjustable flippers and a five DOF manipulator arm. In several test scenarios, it is shown that the proposed approach effectively prevents tip-over and increases robot stability. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.\"],\n",

Deployment of the system in real-world scenarios truthfully verifies its operational constraints, given by limited onboard sensing suites and processing capabilities.

Firstly, regarding specified road traffic environment, the combinations of the possible relative position and moving direction of the ego-vehicle and the surrounding traffic participants were analyzed to determine the complex scenario group. Secondly, each possible direction of movement determined by the ego-vehicle function was respectively combined with the possible movement direction of each interfering vehicle (including any situation in which the interfering vehicle does not exist) by the Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing (PICT) tool, necessary motion constraints were added, and the parameter combination coverage criteria were selected to automatically generate all the combined scenario groups. Finally, combined with the scenario screening rules, the basic test scenario groups covering the various levels and functions with test value were selected. Using the scenario construction method, 62 and 33 basic test scenarios kinds were constructed for the road section scene of an ego-vehicle in the middle lane of a three-lane road and an intersection scene without traffic lights. According to the driver's behavior characteristics, traffic rules, typical vehicle speed, acceleration, deceleration and lateral acceleration in urban, suburban and highway conditions, traffic accidents, and relevant scenario data of the natural driving database, test cases for ego-vehicle lane changing conditions were designed. The model predictive control framework was used to establish the ego-vehicle local path planning and control simulation model. The simulation was carried out for a dangerous vehicle lane change scenario. The simulation results show that the ego-vehicle can realize a deceleration lane change in the case of large deceleration of a front vehicle in the adjacent lane. In addition, collisions with the front vehicle in the same lane and the front and rear vehicle in the adjacent lanes can also be thus avoided, the desired following distance tracked, verifying the effectiveness of the lane change test case. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

    "[13  \t,0,0,\"A coverage motion planning (CMP) is a kind of coverage path planning, which requires the robot path to fill every grid of the workspace. It is an essential issue in plenty of robotic applications. Safety aware collision-free coverage motion planning of an autonomous vehicle is one of the major challenges in intelligent vehicle systems. Many studies have been focused on the obstacle avoidance to prevent 'too close' or 'too far' from obstacles, but difficult to obtain an optimal path. In this paper, a virtual obstacle (VO) based safety aware strategy integrated with a biologically inspired neural network (BNN) method is proposed for CMP in a non-stationary environment as safety consideration is greatly crucial in vehicle CMP.

    "[14  \t,0,0,\"A crucial challenge to efficient and robust motion planning for autonomous vehicles is understanding the intentions of the surrounding agents. Ignoring the intentions of the other agents in dynamic environments can lead to risky or overconservative plans. In this work, we model the motion planning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose an online system that combines an intent recognition algorithm and a POMDP solver to generate risk-bounded plans for the ego vehicle navigating with a number of dynamic agent vehicles. The intent recognition algorithm predicts the probabilistic hybrid motion states of each agent vehicle over a finite horizon using Bayesian filtering and a library of pre-learned maneuver motion models. We update the POMDP model with the intent recognition results in real time and solve it using a heuristic search algorithm which produces policies with upper-bound guarantees on the probability of near colliding with other dynamic agents. We demonstrate that our system is able to generate better motion plans in terms of efficiency and safety in a number of challenging environments including unprotected intersection left turns and lane changes as compared to the baseline methods. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

    "[17  \t,0,0,\"A detailed analysis of the path traversed by the rear wheels of the bus is useful in highway design, and in the placement of curbs at intersections. In fact, when a bus turns a corner, the rear wheel could move into the path of a passing motorist or pedestrian by generating an hazard situation, as in the cases of traffic circles and changing lanes. Of course, the same problems regard long trucks, semi-trailer trucks and articulated vehicles, but also bicycles (tandem) and motorbikes. In particular, the path of the rear wheels of a bus or a long vehicle in general, is a tractrix or equi-tangential curve, which is different by that traced by the front wheels. The planar motion of the chassis of the vehicle can be represented by means of the centrodes, which are traced by the instant center of rotation on the ground (fixed centrode) and on the moving plane that is attached to the vehicle (moving centrode), respectively. Thus, the pure-rolling motion of the moving centrode that is represented by the axis of the rear wheel, on the fixed centrode (catenary) can reproduce the planar motion of the chassis. This paper deals with the formulation of a suitable algorithm for the kinematic analysis of the planar motion of vehicles that travel corners, traffic circles and changing lanes. The tractrix is considered as the involute of the fixed centrode (catenary), which takes also the rule of evolute. The inflection and the cuspidal or return circles, along with the Euler-Savary equation and the Aronhold Theorems, give other useful information on the planar motion of the chassis. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.\"],\n",

    "[19  \t,0,0,\"A distributed approach is proposed for planning a cooperative tracking task for a team of heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking multiple predictable ground targets in a known urban environment. The solution methodology involves finding visibility regions, from which the UAV can maintain line-of-sight to each target during the scenario, and restricted regions, in which a UAV cannot fly, due to the presence of buildings or other airspace limitations.

The latter challenge is of high importance to achieve the accuracy required for manipulation, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate experimental results performing manipulation in unknown environment.

To this aim, the AUV was upgraded with an in-house-developed laser scanner to gather three-dimensional (3D) point clouds for building, in real time, an occupancy grid map (octomap) of the environment. The MR-MHA* motion planner used this octomap to plan, in real time, collision-free trajectories. To achieve the accuracy required to complete the task, a vision-based navigation method was employed. In addition, to reinforce the safety, accounting for the localization uncertainty, a cost function was introduced to keep minimum clearance in the planning. Moreover a visual-servoing method had to be implemented to complete the last step of the manipulation with the desired accuracy. Lastly, we further analyzed the approach performance from both loose-coupling and clearance perspectives.

Our prototype demonstrator is inspired by the classic wire loop game which involves guiding a metal loop along the path of a curved wire from start to finish while avoiding any contact between the wire and the loop. Our work shows that the RL-agent is capable of learning how to control the robot to successfully play the wire loop game without the need of modeling the wire or programming the robot motion beforehand. Furthermore, the extension of the system by a visual sensor (a camera) allows the agent to sufficiently generalize the learning problem so that it can solve new or reshaped wires without the need of additional learning.

    "[63  \t,1,1,\"A novel driving-behavior-oriented method is proposed in this paper for improving trajectory planning performance of autonomous vehicle driving on urban structural road. Differ from the irregularity and unpredictability of escaping a maze or travelling on off-road, the driving on road emphasizes more on the compliance of road traffic rules and the satisfaction of passenger comfort rather than purely pursuing the shortest route or the shortest time. Therefore, the driving-behavior-oriented framework is employed in trajectory planning, which divides trajectory into lane change, turn and U-turn, according to the basic traffic rules and the daily behaviors of drivers. The presented approach mainly includes basic path planning, fast-bias RRT path planning and velocity planning. The basic path planning consists of lane change, turn and U-turn behaviors, which generates smooth path with continuous curvature. In order to ensure the completeness of the programming algorithm, a fast-bias RRT (FB-RRT) algorithm is embedded. As guiding by the driving behavior, normal random, goal-bias and Gaussian sampling strategies are fused to form FB-RRT, which could make the best use of the basic path planning and reduce the randomness of node’s extension to save the computation time.

The planner has been tested in simulation and a real vehicle in various typical scenarios. Test results illustrate that the presented method could generate a trajectory with controllable extrema of curvature as well as with continuous and smooth enough curvature. Besides, generated trajectory has short length, high success rate (no less than 80% average success rate in complex environment) and real time (the average period is less than 100 ms).

    "[86  \t,1,1,\"A primary task in autonomous driving is to design a control algorithm that presents an effective and yet human-compatible behavior. To this aim, present paper considers the problem of autonomous overtaking under both state and environment constraints with dynamic surrounding vehicles. The solution is formulated based on quadratic programming optimization and is solved in receding horizon fashion. The proposed method evaluates the traffic condition online and executes a safe trajectory of an overtaking maneuver with on-coming traffic. To better incorporate traffic participants’ behaviors, a dynamic predictive model-based reachability analysis of the surrounding vehicles is utilized in the design. Reachable sets aim to ensure the drivability of the planned motions, as well as producing drivable collision-free trajectories. To this end, forward reachable sets are employed by predicting traffic vehicles’ future actual and worst-case behaviors in the design, in which the autonomous vehicle determines its trajectory accordingly.

A nominal trajectory, planned for performing a given mission, is represented by means of motion primitives, that is segments and arcs flown in a steady-state condition. The risk of hitting a person on the ground after catastrophic failure is evaluated as a function of vehicle reliability and population density (assumed known), and position of the impact point (which depends on initial conditions at the time of failure and trajectory flown afterwards). In the deterministic case, a lethal area is introduced and the risk at each point on the ground is proportional to the amount of time spent by the point inside the lethal area. Under the assumptions of a ballistic fall, the position of the lethal area with respect to the nominal trajectory depends only on altitude and velocity at the time of failure. When the effect of navigation errors is introduced, impact points are described by a statistical impact footprint, assuming that position and velocity errors at time of failure are normally distributed with known standard deviations.

For this purpose, a closed-loop rapidly-exploring random tree (CL-RRT) algorithm is presented. This CL-RRT consists of three tightly coupled components: a RRT algorithm, three fuzzy proportional-derivative controllers for heading and diving control and a six degree-of-freedom nonlinear AUV model.

The feasibility of each branch and random offspring vertex in the CL-RRT is checked against the mentioned constraints of AUV.

A candidate Lyapunov function inspired by this structure is used to assess the stability of the yaw dynamics while tracking straight-line trajectories and steady turns. The basin of attraction of the controller is limited by actuator constraints and the presence of unstable equilibrium points during turns with high lateral acceleration. The controller properties and the stability of yaw dynamics are demonstrated in simulation. © 2011 IEEE.\"],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

    "[114 \t,0,0,\"A visual perception module can use cameras to obtain various image features for detecting peripheral information, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in the visual field of self-driving vehicle. This module is an effective and low cost perception method for autonomous driving. Motion planning provides self-driving vehicles with a series of motion parameters and driving actions from the initial state to the target state of the vehicle. It makes the vehicle subject to collision avoidance and dynamic constraints from the external environment and spatial-temporal constraint from the internal system during the whole traveling process. Traditional autonomous driving approaches refer to constructing intermediate processes from the sensor inputs to the actuator outputs into a plurality of independent submodules, such as perception, planning, decision making, and control. However, traditional modular approaches require the design and selection of features, camera calibration, and manual adjustment of parameters. Therefore, autonomous driving systems based on traditional modular approaches do not have complete autonomy. With the rapid development of big data, computer performance, and deep learning algorithms, increasing researchers apply deep learning to autonomous driving. An end-to-end model based on deep learning obtains the vehicle motion parameters directly from the perceived data and can fully embody the autonomy of autonomous driving. Thus, this model has been widely investigated in recent years. The representative and cutting-edge papers published locally and overseas are summarized in this paper to fully review the research progress of end-to-end motion planning for autonomous driving with visual perception. Applications of the end-to-end model in computer vision tasks and games are introduced. The complexity of tasks solved by end-to-end approaches is higher than that of autonomous driving in some other fields. End-to-end approaches can be successfully applied in the commercial field of autonomous driving. The important roles of visual perception and motion planning in end-to-end autonomous driving are analyzed by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different input and output modes. On the basis of the learning methods of autonomous vehicles, the implementation methods of end-to-end motion planning for autonomous driving with visual perception are divided into imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Imitation learning methods can be divided into two major mainstream algorithms, namely, behavior cloning and dataset aggregation. Two recently proposed imitation learning methods, including observation imitation and conditional imitation learning, are analyzed. In reinforcement learning, value-based and policy-based methods are mainly introduced. Advanced reinforcement learning methods, such as inverse reinforcement learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning, are presented. The research of the end-to-end model for autonomous driving faces transitions from virtual scenarios to real scenarios at this stage. Transfer learning methods are combined from three aspects, including image conversion, domain adaptation, and domain randomization. On this basis, the basic idea and network structure of each method are described. Autonomous driving models are usually evaluated in a simulation environment by means of public datasets and simulation platforms. The datasets and simulation platforms related to autonomous driving are listed and analyzed from the perspectives of publication time, configuration, and applicable condition. The existing problems, challenges, thinking, and outlook are summarized. End-to-end motion planning for autonomous driving with visual perception has strong universality and simple structure. However, explaining and ensuring absolute safety are difficult. The method of generating accountable intermediate representation is expected to solve the inexplicable problem. Therefore, end-to-end motion planning methods for autonomous driving with visual perception have a broad application prospect and research value.

First, in order to track the moving target in 3D environment, the LGVF method is improved by introducing flight height into the traditional Lyapunov function, and the generated velocity can guide UAV converge gradually to the limit cycle in horizontal plane and the optimal height in vertical plane. Then, the IFDS method imitating the phenomenon of fluid flow is utilized to plan the collision-free path. To achieve the mission of tracking moving target and avoid static or dynamic obstacle at the same time, the guidance vector field by LGVF is taken as the original fluid of IFDS. As the fluid system still remains stable under the influence of obstacles, the disturbed streamline from the interfered fluid can be regarded as the planned path. Third, as the quality of route is mainly influenced by the repulsive and tangential parameters of IFDS, the real-time suboptimal route can be planned by the varying receding-horizon optimization according to the predicted motion.

Therefore, we extend from a single intersection to a grid of intersections and propose a novel vehicle routing method for autonomous vehicles that can effectively reduce the travel time of each vehicle. With dedicated short range communications and the fine-grained control of autonomous vehicles, we are able to apply wire routing algorithms with modified constraints to vehicle routing. Our method intelligently avoids congestions by simulating the future traffic and thereby achieving a system optimum. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.\"],\n",

Secondly, a high-level controller and a low-level controller for the longitudinal motion are respectively designed to realize functions of the longitudinal planning and control. Based on the PF model, the longitudinal high-level controller can calculate the desired acceleration by optimizing a cost function that takes the potential risk, comfort and driving efficiency into consideration. And the longitudinal low-level controller essentially implements an adaptive PID algorithm to make the controlled vehicle follow the acceleration command well. Finally, the designed longitudinal planning and control module is integrated with a lateral planning and control module studied previously, which is also based on the same PF model. The feasibility of the proposed method in different traffic scenarios including approaching, cut-in and overtaking with multiple traffic participants is verified by co-simulation tests of CarSim/Simulink and hardware-in-the-loop tests.

In each UAV planning path, the UAV incurs some costs, including control costs to change the direction angle, route costs to bypass the threats, and threat costs to acquire some probability to be destroyed by threats.

    "[197 \t,0,0,\"An unmanned surface vehicle (USV) plans its global path before the mission starts. When dynamic obstacles appear during sailing, the planned global path must be adjusted locally to avoid collision. This study proposes a local path planning algorithm based on the velocity obstacle (VO) method and modified quantum particle swarm optimization (MQPSO) for USV collision avoidance. The collision avoidance model based on VO not only considers the velocity and course of the USV but also handles the variable velocity and course of an obstacle. According to the collision avoidance model, the USV needs to adjust its velocity and course simultaneously to avoid collision. Due to the kinematic constraints of the USV, the velocity window and course window of the USV are determined by the dynamic window approach (DWA). In summary, local path planning is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem with multiple constraints in a continuous search space. The optimization problem is to obtain the USV's optimal velocity variation and course variation to avoid collision and minimize its energy consumption under the rules of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and the kinematic constraints of the USV. Since USV local path planning is completed in a short time, it is essential that the optimization algorithm can quickly obtain the optimal value. MQPSO is primarily proposed to meet that requirement. In MQPSO, the efficiency of quantum encoding in quantum computing and the optimization ability of representing the motion states of the particles with wave functions to cover the whole feasible solution space are combined.

Moreover, the proposed heuristic can be easily used in the future globally optimal algorithm (if it will exist) to speed the computation time. The performance of the proposed solution, such as reduction ratio of computational complexity, is analyzed. Simulations based on the Manhattan taxi data set show that the computing time is reduced by 22% compared with the exhaustive search method under the same service quality performance. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[222 \t,1,1,\"As mobile robots and autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent in human-centred environments, there is a need to control the risk of collision. Perceptual modules, for example machine vision, provide uncertain estimates of object location. In that context, the frequently made assumption of an exactly known free-space is invalid. Clearly, no paths can be guaranteed to be collision free. Instead, it is necessary to compute the probabilistic risk of collision on any proposed path. The FPR algorithm, proposed here, efficiently calculates an upper bound on the risk of collision for a robot moving on the plane. That computation orders candidate trajectories according to (the bound on) their degree of risk. Then paths within a user-defined threshold of primary risk could be selected according to secondary criteria such as comfort and efficiency. The key contribution of this letter is the FPR algorithm and its 'convolution trick' to factor the integrals used to bound the risk of collision. As a consequence of the convolution trick, given K obstacles and N candidate paths, the computational load is reduced from the naive O(NK), to the qualitatively faster O(N+K). © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[223 \t,0,0,\"As one of the most basic behaviors of vehicles in the intelligent transportation system, the lane changing in highway environment influences the safety and efficiency of driving. As a result, it has always been paid much attention by researchers. In the process of the lane changing, it is necessary to consider the kinematic constraints and optimization of safety and rapidity. The existed geometrical methods mainly use curves to fit the path without considering the kinematic constraints of the vehicle. In this paper, we study and design the overall frame of generating the path for lane changing using model predictive control. Model predictive control shows its advantage in solving multi-constraint optimization and predicting the future states. Therefore it is used to optimize the rapidity and smoothness of the lane changing process. Software simulation proves that the trajectory planned by the model predictive control has better smoothness than the trajectory planned by the geometrical method. Finally, a lane changing experiment is conducted on the micro vehicle-based hardware simulation platform. The experimental result further verifies the feasibility of the proposed path planning method. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

Many ocean vehicles, especially those used in longer-range missions, possess limited operating speeds and are thus sensitive to ocean currents. Yet, the effect of currents on their trajectories is ignored by many coordination techniques. To address this issue, we first derive a rigorous level-set methodology for distance-based coordination of vehicles operating in minimum time within strong and dynamic ocean currents. The new methodology integrates ocean modeling, time-optimal level-sets and optimization schemes to predict the ocean currents, the short-term reachability sets, and the optimal headings for the desired coordination. Schemes are developed for dynamic formation control, where multiple vehicles achieve and maintain a given geometric pattern as they carry out their missions. To do so, a new score function that is suitable for regular polygon formations is obtained. Secondly, we obtain an efficient, non-intrusive technique for level-set-based time-optimal path planning in the presence of moving obstacles. The results are time-optimal path forecasts that rigorously avoid moving obstacles and sustain the desired coordination. They are exemplified and investigated for a variety of simulated ocean flows. A wind-driven double-gyre flow is used to study time-optimal dynamic formation control. Currents exiting an idealized strait or estuary are employed to explore dynamic obstacle avoidance.

The approach, based on numerical optimisation within convex region constraints is described in detail, and numerical results for curvature and sharpness are compared to a cubic spline on a small number of simulated environments. The clothoid spline is less affected, in terms of its objective function, by a shift in the obstacle boundaries than a cubic spline, for obstacle shifts below 0.5m. The clothoid spline takes longer to converge for but the output path has attractive qualities like lower peak sharpness, enabling high speed operation. The method is therefore most useful for applications where path quality is important and updates are required less frequently. Changing the objective function by increasing weighting parameter b allowed the path shape to be tuned to reduce the peak sharpness, at the cost of increasing the total length. With b > 100, convergence was poor because parts of the spline were pushed outside the assigned region, an artefact arising from the constraints only being enforced at the start and end of each segment.

However, deadlock resolution among vehicles is still a thorny issue. Many algorithms re-plan motion paths to avoid deadlocks resulting in greatly increasing the computational complexity, while other deadlock resolution algorithms in which vehicles have fixed paths are less efficient. This paper proposes a spare zone based hierarchical (SZH) motion coordination algorithm supporting time-efficient collision-and-deadlock resolution among vehicles. Unlike previous deadlock resolution methods in which the vehicles can change their paths to avoid deadlocks at any time, SZH avoids deadlocks just by locally adjusting their paths in a decentralized manner. The introduction of a spare zone mechanism ensures reliable resolution of different types of collision and deadlocks while achieving high time efficiency. The allocation of spare zones for each vehicle before performing their missions guarantees that there exist enough free zones to which the vehicles taking part in deadlocks can temporary departs from their current path to avoid deadlocks. In order to improve the efficiency, the vehicle's spare zones are updated as soon as the vehicle arrives at a zone. The algorithm is realized based on a hierarchical strategy, where the top layer considers the allocation and update of spare zones, while the bottom layer considers the coordination among vehicles within two zones.

    "[245 \t,1,1,\"Automated vehicles are rapidly emerging as the new generation of transport tools. Relevant research mainly focuses on collision avoidance, lane keeping, and coordination control to ensure driving safety and improve efficiency, with little emphasis on passenger comfort. This paper proposes a set of comfortbased velocity control strategies on the basis of driving safety. Driving comfort was evaluated by multiple accelerometers fixed inside vehicles. Power spectral density analysis and one-third octave band filtering were applied to derive the weighted root mean square acceleration as an evaluation indicator for comfort. The annoy rate model is proposed to describe individual sensitivity to vibration. Field tests were conducted to investigate interactions between pavement roughness, speed, and comfort, and multiple linear relationships were identified. Three typical processes were considered: deceleration phase, uniform speed phase and abnormal occasions. The hyperbolic tangent function was utilized to provide moderate deceleration. Model parameters were set to guarantee maximal deceleration and jerk within acceptable limits. Nonlinear programming was used to balance between rapid deceleration and bumps caused by abnormal obstacles. The proposed strategy can potentially be applied for automated vehicles to improve the perceived quality of automated driving. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[246 \t,0,0,\"Automatic Parking Assist System (APAS) is an important part of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). It frees drivers from the burden of maneuvering a vehicle into a narrow parking space. This paper deals with the motion planning, a key issue of APAS, for vehicles in automatic parking. Planning module should guarantee the robustness to various initial postures and ensure that the vehicle is parked symmetrically in the center of the parking slot. However, current planning methods can't meet both requirements well. To meet the aforementioned requirements, a method combining neural network and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is adopted in this work. From a driver's perspective, different initial postures imply different parking strategies. In order to achieve the robustness to diverse initial postures, a natural idea is to train a model that can learn various strategies. As artificial neural network has outstanding potential in representing and learning knowledge, a neural network is utilized to provide prior knowledge, which is trained through supervised learning by a novel method that imitates human learning style. However, the training accuracy and generalization ability of a neural network, together with the quality of training data, will interfere with the robustness and terminal parking performance of a planning module inevitably. To counter this, a particular variant of MCTS (P-MCTS), which can memorize the best sequence with the highest reward, is combined with the neural network to select the final action by taking Monte-Carlo samples among possible candidates produced by the neural network. Compared with the standard MCTS, P-MCTS performs better in one-player puzzle like automatic parking. Using this method, for the planning part, the robustness to various initial postures and good terminal parking performance can be guaranteed simultaneously, which is verified by the simulations of Matlab and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. © 2020 SAE International.

When the self-driving car executes the follow-up instruction, the road smoothness in front of the car will affect the driving safety and comfort of the car. The real-time acquisition of road information in front of driving will help the self-driving car adjust driving behavior.

Currently, little research work specifically focuses on imputating the incomplete road point cloud data that are caused by obstacle vehicles. In this paper, we propose a fast method to imputate the incomplete road point cloud data using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation algorithm to enhance the safety of autonomous driving. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, two groups of experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate the following: (1) the known point cloud data within 5 meters around the obstacle vehicle are sufficient to guarantee the imputation accuracy; (2) when the weight parameter of the IDW interpolation is 4, the efficiency and accuracy of the imputation can be optimally balanced; and (3) it takes approximately 0.6 seconds to imputate the incomplete dataset consisting of 15 million points, while the imputation error is approximately 5 millimeters.

The key to efficient motion planning and navigation is accurate self-localization.

This paper proposes a method to accurately self-localize an ego-vehicle at an urban intersection. In addition, the paper also proposes to localize and understand the behavior of the surrounding traffic participants in order to help the ego-vehicle navigate through complex urban intersections. Ego-localization has been dominated mainly by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) sensors. However in urban areas, GNSS performance is severely degraded due to Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) and multipathl effects. In order to rectify the pseudo-range error caused by NLOS and multipath, our research group proposed to improve 3D GNSS methods by taking advantage of 3D building maps. However our previous positioning system still suffers from error along the longitudinal direction and the heading direction, which is significant for localizing ego-vehicle and estimating the position of other traffic participants. Also since lane-markings are not visible at intersections, vision based lane detection will fail in these cases and will lead to large positioning error. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes to integrate 3D building matching with our previous 3D GNSS/INS/lane detection method in order to improve the longitudinal position and orientation estimation of the ego-vehicle. Furthermore, accurate localization is extremely important to detect the behavior of surrounding traffic participants. Thus, the detected and filtered state estimates of the surrounding vehicles are formulated into a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) in order to infer their behavior at the intersection. This situation recognition, which is the key to motion planning, is addressed in our paper using DBN. The construction of the DBN is based on learning from the data collected from the real traffic scenes.

    "[298 \t,0,0,\"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic platforms that are commonly used to map the sea floor, for example for benthic surveys or for naval mine countermeasures (MCM) operations. AUVs create an acoustic image of the survey area, such that objects on the seabed can be identified and, in the case of MCM, mines can be found and disposed of. The common method for creating such seabed maps is to run a lawnmower survey, which is a standard method in coverage path planning. We are interested in exploring alternate techniques for surveying areas of interest, in order to reduce mission time and/or assess feasible actions, such as finding a safe path through a hazardous region. In this paper, we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to build models of seabed complexity data. We evaluate five commonly used kernels to assess modeling performance. Our results show that an additive Matérn kernel is most suitable for modeling seabed complexity data. On top of the GP model, we use adaptations of two standard path planning methods, A? and RRT?, to find potentially safe paths for marine vessels through the modeled areas. We evaluate the planned paths in terms of length and complexity, and run a vehicle dynamics simulator to assess potential performance by a marine vessel. Finally, we propose three approaches for on-line AUV survey path planning. The AUV decides on-line where to survey, based on the GP model it is creating and the GP's uncertainty along potential safe paths for marine vessels. Our simulation results show that using onboard on-line AUV survey planning greatly reduces survey time needed by the AUV compared to running a full lawnmower survey with off-line vessel path planning. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

The goal of path planning is to find a feasible path from the start-point to the target-point in a given environment.

This paper proposes an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based approach, termed as learning fixed-height histogram (LFHH) to solve path planning problems for AUVs in dynamic environment. The LFHH uses a learning transformation strategy (LTS) to improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, a smooth method is employed to accelerate the speed of finding feasible paths. Moreover, a planning window is adopted to help handle dynamic factors.

We employ the exact differential equations for time-optimal path planning and develop theory and numerical schemes to accurately predict three-dimensional optimal paths for several classes of marine vehicles, respecting their specific propulsion constraints. We further show that the three-dimensional path planning problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional one if the motion of the vehicle is partially known, e.g. if the vertical component of the motion is forced. This reduces the computational cost. We then apply the developed theory in three-dimensional analytically known flow fields to verify the schemes, benchmark the accuracy, and demonstrate capabilities.

This investigation presents two algorithms for autonomous vehicle navigation in unknown environments with obstacles. Basic building blocks of the path-planning algorithms are the behaviour-based controller and nonlinear state estimator.

The estimate is then used to decide the possible control action from a family of behaviour-based controllers for navigating the vehicle. The first path-planning algorithm uses the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimating the vehicle position using measurements of the obstacle position. The second path-planning algorithm uses the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate thevehicle position.

Specifically, some existing approaches of collision checking deal with lofty and dwarf obstacles, or wide and narrow, negative obstacles in the same manner that require the entire vehicle body to steer awayfrom them. However, some dwarf obstacles are shorter than the chassis of the vehicle while some negative obstacles are narrower than the vehicle track. In those cases, overstriding maneuvers will prove much more efficient and reasonable. Moreover, dealing with these obstacles in the same wayas lofty obstacles can dramatically reduce the flexibility and disturb the stability of path planning under clustered environments, especially when the vehicle moves at higher speed.

In order to make the planned path for overtaking manoeuvres safer, an improved harmonic velocity potential approach for path planning is presented, which innovatively enhances the effect of an obstacle potential on a road by adding a scale term, so that it can generate a smooth path for a vehicle-overtaking manoeuvre. All the potentials which are used for vehicle lane keeping or lane changing are well designed. The lateral-path-following module is based on the constrained linear model predictive control approach, which ensures that the host vehicle can follow the planned path precisely. Furthermore, when the overtaking manoeuvre is not suitable, the fuzzy adaptive following module is utilized to ensure that the host vehicle can adaptively keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. Tactical decisions, such as overtaking, accelerating or decelerating, are determined by the decision-making module. Finally, several typical scenarios with low traffic on a straight road or a curved road are simulated to verify the effectiveness and the feasibility of the active collision avoidance system.

Managing risk exposures through driving operational design domains (ODD) will also become prevalent. Ultimately, the deployment of AVs will hinge on the premise that they are safer than humans.

Current methodologies for the verification of AV's decision and control systems attempt to divorce the lower level, short-term trajectory planning and trajectory tracking functions from the behavioral rules-based framework that governs mid-term actions. Such analysis is typically predicated on the discretization of the state space and has several limitations. First, it requires that a conservative buffer be added around obstacles such that many feasible plans are classified as unsafe. Second, the discretized controllers modeled in this analysis require several refinement steps before being implementable on an actual AV, and typically do not allow the specification of comfort-related properties on the trajectories. Consumer-ready AVs use motion planning algorithms that generate smooth trajectories. While viable algorithms exist for the generation of smooth trajectories originating from a single state, analysis should consider that the AV faces state estimation errors and disturbances. Verification is restricted to a discretized state space with fixed-size cells; this assumption can artificially limit the set of available trajectories if the discretization is too coarse. Conversely, too fine of a discretization renders the problem intractable for automated analysis. This work presents a new verification tool, APEX, which investigates the combined action of a behavioral planner and state lattice-based motion planner to guarantee a safe vehicle trajectory is chosen. In APEX, decisions made at the behavioral layer can be traced through to the spatio-temporal evolution of the AV and verified.

For an autonomous full tracked vehicle (FTV), the uneven terrain has a great impact on the stability and safety. In this paper, we proposed a method to predict the pose of the FTV based on accurate road elevation information obtained by 3D sensors. If we could predict the pose of the FTV traveling on uneven terrain, we would not only control the active suspension system but also change the driving trajectory to improve the safety and stability. In the first, 3D laser scanners were used to get real-time cloud data points of the terrain for extracting the elevation information of the terrain. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GPS are essential to get accurate attitude angle and position information. Then, the dynamics model of the FTV was established to calculate the vehicle’s pose. Finally, the Kalman filter was used to improve the accuracy of the predicted pose.

The automation of parking/pick-up in the system hinges on the path planning efficiency of the AGV. Considering the numerous disconnected paths in intelligent parking systems, this paper introduces the fallback strategy to improve ant colony optimization (ACO) for path planning in AGV-based intelligent parking system. Meanwhile, the valuation function was adopted to optimize the calculation process of the heuristic information, and the reward/penalty mechanism was employed to the pheromone update strategy. In this way, the improved ACO could plan the optimal path for the AGV from the starting point to the destination, without sacrificing the search efficiency. Next, the optimal combination of ACO parameters was identified through repeated simulations. Finally, a typical parking lot was abstracted into a topological map, and used to compare the path planning results between the improved ACO and the classic ACO. The comparison confirms the effectiveness of the improved ACO in path planning for AGV-based intelligent parking system. © 2013 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[363 \t,1,1,\"Behavior and motion planning play an important role in automated driving. Traditionally, behavior planners instruct local motion planners with predefined behaviors. Due to the high scene complexity in urban environments, unpredictable situations may occur in which behavior planners fail to match predefined behavior templates. Recently, general-purpose planners have been introduced, combining behavior and local motion planning. These general-purpose planners allow behavior-aware motion planning given a single reward function. However, two challenges arise: First, this function has to map a complex feature space into rewards. Second, the reward function has to be manually tuned by an expert. Manually tuning this reward function becomes a tedious task. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on human driving demonstrations to automatically tune reward functions. This study offers important insights into the driving style optimization of general-purpose planners with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach based on the expected value difference between learned and demonstrated policies. Furthermore, we compare the similarity of human driven trajectories with optimal policies of our planner under learned and expert-tuned reward functions.

And combined with MATLAB, the simulation is carried out from the longitudinal relative speed of the two vehicles and the horizontal relative distance between the two vehicles. The results show that the critical time calculated by the sinusoidal model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is lower, and the critical time calculated by the polynomial curve model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is higher.

This paper proposes a design for autonomous multi-lane cruising by combining a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with a novel state-action space abstraction. While the proposed solution follows the classical hierarchy of behavior decision, motion planning and control, it introduces a key intermediate abstraction within the motion planner to discretize the state-action space according to high level behavioral decisions. We argue that this design allows principled modular extension of motion planning, in contrast to using either monolithic behavior cloning or a large set of handwritten rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that our state-action space abstraction allows transferring of the trained models without retraining from a simulated environment with virtually no dynamics to one with significantly more realistic dynamics.

By taking into account the intent of every agent, the ego agent can incorporate future interactions with human-driven vehicles into its planning. The problem is often formulated as a multi-agent game and solved using iterative algorithms operating on a discretized action or state space. Even if converging to a Nash equilibrium, the result will often be only sub-optimal. In this paper, we define a linear differential game for a set of interacting agents and solve it to optimality using mixed-integer programming. A disjunctive formulation of the orientation allows us to formulate linear constraints to prevent agent-to-agent collision while preserving the non-holonomic motion properties of the vehicle model. Soft constraints account for prediction errors. We then define a joint cost function, where a cooperation factor can adapt between altruistic, cooperative, and egoistic behavior. We study the influence of the cooperation factor to solve scenarios, where interaction between the agents is necessary to solve them successfully. The approach is then evaluated in a racing scenario, where we show the applicability of the formulation in a closed-loop receding horizon replanning fashion. By accounting for inaccuracies in the cooperative assumption and the actual behavior, we can indeed successfully plan an optimal control strategy interacting closely with other agents. © 2020 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[415 \t,0,0,\"Coverage path planning determines a path that guides an autonomous vehicle to pass every part of a workspace completely and efficiently. Since turns are often costly for autonomous vehicles, minimizing the number of turns usually produces more working efficiency. This paper presents an optimization approach to minimize the number of turns of autonomous vehicles in coverage path planning. For complex polygonal fields, the problem is reduced to finding the optimal decomposition of the original field into simple subfields. The optimization criterion is minimization of the sum of widths of these decomposed subfields. Here, a new algorithm is designed based on a multiple sweep line decomposition. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n2 log n). Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can provide nearly optimal solutions very efficiently when compared against recent state-of-the-art.

    "[416 \t,0,0,\"Crash avoidance and mitigation is still one of the major challenges faced by the autonomous vehicles industry. Path planning in autonomous vehicles is a crucial phase during crash avoidance with other vehicles. It is important for the path planning algorithm to be reactive in uncertain situations which usually arise in urban road scenarios. This study proposes a reactive online path planning strategy for obstacle avoidance and crash mitigation for an imminent collision with another vehicle. A cubic Bezier curve trajectory generation method is used for creating a maneuver around the obstacle vehicle. Relative hitting heading angle is considered to account for the crash severity between two vehicles. Two cases are considered where one is an imminent crash scenario and the other is where an obstacle can be avoided with a minimum safety distance. This obstacle avoidance problem is then converted to an optimization problem where potential crash severity, vehicle kinematic constraints and path smoothness are considered as constraints. The resulting cost function consists of a quadratic convex function and a piecewise defined function. This is further solved using a novel methodology where the piecewise function is included in the inequality constraints, so that the problem can be solved using quadratic programming method. This will also lead to a quick real time implementation. It is shown that the proposed method is able to avoid collisions and also minimizes the crash severity in case of an imminent collision. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

We anticipate that this fraction will increase in the coming decades before, if ever, we have a fully automated transportation system. Motivated by this we address the problem of provable safety of mixed traffic consisting of both intelligent vehicles (IVs) as well as human driven vehicles (HVs). An important issue that arises is that such mixed systems may well have lesser throughput than all-human traffic systems, if the automated vehicles are expected to remain provably safe with respect to human traffic. This necessitates the consideration of strategies such as platooning of automated vehicles in order to increase the throughput. In this paper we address the design of provably safe systems consisting of a mix of automated and human-driven vehicles including the use of platooning by automated vehicles. We design motion planning policies and coordination rules for participants in this novel mixed system. HVs are considered as nearsighted and modeled with relatively loose constraints, while IVs are considered as capable of following much tighter constraints. HVs are expected to follow reasonable and simple rules. IVs are designed to move under a model predictive control (MPC) based motion plans and coordination protocols.

However, the flight time of a real UAV is time constrained, and therefore only a limited number of target locations can typically be visited within the mission. In this paper, we address the data collection planning problem called the Dubins Orienteering Problem with Neighborhoods (DOPN), which sets out to determine the sequence of visits to the most rewarding subset of target locations, each with an associated reward, within a given travel budget. The objective of the DOPN is thus to maximize the sum of the rewards collected from the visited target locations using a budget constrained path between predefined starting and ending locations. The variant of the orienteering problem addressed here uses curvature-constrained Dubins vehicle model for planning the data collection missions for UAV. Moreover, in the DOPN, it is also assumed that the data, and thus the reward, may be collected from a close neighborhood sensing distance around the target locations, e.g., taking a snapshot by an onboard camera with a wide field of view, or using a sensor with a long range. We propose a novel approach based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic for the DOPN, in which combinatorial optimization of the sequence for visiting the target locations is simultaneously addressed with continuous optimization for finding Dubins vehicle waypoints inside the neighborhoods of the visited targets.

In this paper, an AI behavior arbitration algorithm for Autonomous Driving (AD) is proposed. The method, coined AIBA (AI Behavior Arbitration), has been developed in two stages: (i) human driving scene description and understanding and (ii) formal modelling. The description of the scene is achieved by mimicking a human cognition model, while the modelling part is based on a formal representation which approximates the human driver understanding process. The advantage of the formal representation is that the functional safety of the system can be analytically inferred.

The environment uncertainty is one of the challenges that we face in trajectory planning. For autonomous vehicle, to be efficient, they need to be able to deal with this kind of uncertainty. In this paper, we show that the theory of belief functions with its ability to distinguish between different types of uncertainty is able to provide significant advantages in the context of trajectory planning.

Those tentacles represent possible trajectories that consider the current dynamical state of the vehicle and make a smooth variation in the vehicle dynamic variables. Once the representation of the environment and the possible trajectories are generated, an evaluation of each trajectory is carried out according to several criteria and the choice of the trajectory is made using the decision formalism of Markov decision process.

Marked by their zero carbon footprints, environmental groups strongly support these vehicles. For these reasons sales have been increasing steadily in the past few years. Due to that fact that it's still a new field, a lot of work relating to the electric vehicle technology is yet to be analyzed and developed. Electric vehicle powertrain optimization, routing, modeling, and path planning are some of these examples.

    "[475 \t,1,1,\"Emergency Braking Maneuver (EBM) and Emergency Lane-Changing Maneuver (ELCM) are the most common collision avoidance maneuvers when obstacles suddenly appear in front of the vehicle. In order to establish a more effective collision avoidance decision model, based on the analysis of the critical collision condition under emergency scenes, this paper proposes a decision algorithm for collision avoidance in view of the minimum Longitudinal Safety Distance (LSD). Firstly, we have determined the decision principle that the effect of collision avoidance is positively correlated with the minimum LSD. By comparing the minimum LSD of EBM and ELCM, the internal decision-making rules are designed for the Emergency Maneuver Decision System module of autonomous vehicles. Then by analyzing the critical safety state between autonomous vehicle and obstacle, the minimum LSD models of EBM and ELCM are established based on road adhesion coefficient, the types ofobstacle, etc. Finally, taken the scene that stationary obstacle suddenly present in front of the autonomous vehicle as the case, we compare the minimum LSD of EBM and ELCM and analyze the effect of different factors, and then the dynamic simulation is performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the above decision algorithm. The results show that the velocity, road adhesion coefficient and the types of obstacle have a great impact on the emergency decision-making, and the simulation results are consistent with the theoretical results, which show that the decision algorithm in this paper can be effectively applied to the autonomous vehicle system. © 2020, Aracne Editrice.

    "[476 \t,0,0,\"Emergency obstacle avoidance is one of the key points for autonomous driving system. A path planning controller based on non-linear model predictive control and a path tracking controller based on linear time-varying model predictive control are designed. In path planning controller, an obstacle-avoiding function is used to adjust the distance between the intelligent vehicle and obstacles by calculating the value of obstacle-avoiding function. A new route is supposed to be planned, which can not only keep away from obstacles but also decrease the deviations from the global course, by considering the different weights of obstacle-avoiding function and the planning error. In path tracking controller, the solution of linear time-varying model predictive control is converted into a positive-definite quadratic program. And then the desired steering angles of front wheel are calculated by using the reference trajectory and orientation angle of vehicle center. The results show that the obstacle-avoiding controller has strong robustness and the path tracking controller has better performance in controlling accuracy and vehicle dynamics stability when a vehicle travels at 60 km/h, 80 km/h, or 100 km/h. The maximal side-slip angle is no more than 1°, and the maximal deviation of yaw angle is less than 2.5°. Obstacle avoiding action occurs in advance with the increase in velocity of autonomous vehicle. In addition, the dual-MPC controller is adaptive to the circumstance of multi-obstacles avoidance as well, which can be easily demonstrated by the small deviation of yaw angles and small side-slip angles. © 2020, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

    "[477 \t,0,0,\"Enabling self-driving vehicles to efficiently and autonomously navigate through an obstacle-filled environment remains a topic of significant contemporary research interest. Motion-planning frameworks, encapsulating both path- and trajectory-planning, have played a dominant role in realizing the deployment of a `sense-think-act`intelligence for autonomous vehicles. However, verification and validation of such intelligence on actual self-driving autonomous vehicles has been limited. Simulation-based verification and validation has the advantage of permitting diverse scenario-based testing and comprehensive `what-if`analyses - but is ultimately limited by the simulation fidelity and realism. In contrast, testing on full-scale real-world systems is constrained by the usual challenges of time, space, and cost engendered in reproducing diverse scenarios in practice. Further, motion-planning frameworks often engender a mixture of global-planning (typically performed offline) coupled with a sensor-based local-planning (typically done online), which requires both simulation and physical testing. Thus, scaled vehicle experimentation provides researchers with an exciting via-media to evaluate the performance and robustness of motion-planning algorithms on actual physical hardware - especially in real-time sensor-based motion planning settings. In this paper, we analyze a 1/10th scale F1/10 vehicle's performance in simulation and the actual hardware. A global planning algorithm is used to provide the waypoints for a feasible collision-free path between the start and goal configurations in the environment. We explored the deployment of Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) and Rapidly exploring Random Tree? (RRT*).

As collisions are inevitable in over-constrained situations, we focus on deciding the liability for a hazard. Our insight is that hazards caused by malfunctions of autonomous vehicles result from loss of functional integrity. Design defects may leave it unnoticed, or the real-world may make integrity- preserving motion infeasible. Guarantee of functional integrity in an observable way at run-time is indispensable for revealing defects by using formal root-cause analysis, and for supporting safety claims by dismissing unreasonable doubts about design defects. From a practitical standpoint, we attempt to formalize a verification problem that consists of a novel criterion for determining liability for hazard, a safety claim comprised of confirmed observable states, and assumptions underlying the safety claim. We propose a run-time scheme of monitoring events that may lead to violations of the assumptions and a precursor to root-causes leading to loss of functional integrity and consequent hazards. We formulate a means of preemptively detecting unsafe motions liable to be hazardous as satisfiability problem within the framework of an adversarial motion planning subject to assumptions on maneuverability of movers.

By approximating the trajectory and acceleration function with B-splines, we transform an infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. Obstacle avoidance and kinematic constraints are carried out with the addition of a penalization function that penalizes trajectories and acceleration functions that do not satisfy the vehicles’ constraints or that are in a collision route with other obstacles. Our approach is designed to model observations of the obstacles that contain measurement errors, which incorporates the realistic stochasticity of radars and sensors. We show that, as the number of observations increases, the estimated optimization function converges to the optimal one where the obstacles’ positions are known.

The behavior planner models an average driver who follows the driving rules according to information provided by a road network map. and also provides the control signal used in the following step. Next, a customized particle filter is integrated with the planner to model the uncertainty of various trajectories and behaviors, using multiple sensing cues such as pose, velocity, acceleration and turn signal use. The proposed method supports various sensor modalities, depending on the availability of additional sensing information. Finally, by including the sensor data the probabilistic process is able to estimate the probabilities of various trajectories and intentions. The proposed method is generic to any driving situation supported by the behavior planner. Intentions such as 'go forward*, 'turn right, 'turn left, 'yield* and 'stop' are supported by the proposed method. Our proposed method is evaluated using multiple, complex, simulated driving situations, and then comparing the simulation's ground truth to the estimated probabilities. Evaluation criteria are how early and accurately our system can estimate the driving trajectory and intention probabilities of the vehicle.

Acquired point clouds are transformed into bird's eye view elevation images, where each pixel represents a grid cell of the horizontal x-y plane. We intentionally encode each pixel using three channels, namely the maximal, median and minimal height value of all points within the respective grid. A major advantage of this three channel representation is that it allows us to utilize common RGB image-based detection networks without modification. The bird's eye view elevation images are processed by a two stage detector.

    "[523 \t,0,0,\"For many navigation scenarios, it is known that the accuracy of navigation state estimates depends on the path traveled, particularly when access to external navigation aids such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available. In this work, we present a path planning method that attempts to minimize the navigation uncertainty of a pair of autonomous vehicles traveling from known initial locations to desired goal locations. For the scenario considered in this study, each vehicle has an onboard odometer for measuring relative changes in position and heading. The vehicles also have sensors for measuring the range between the vehicles. Navigation state estimates are obtained using a centralized batch factor graph approach implemented with the Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping (GTSAM) library. In previous work on this problem, candidate vehicle trajectories were chosen from a restricted class of trajectories referred to as pseudo-zigzagging. An exhaustive search of all possible trajectories in this class revealed that the final position uncertainty could be reduced by a factor of 5 when compared with the case of each vehicle traveling straight to its goal location. In the work we present here, the trajectories are no longer restricted to such a limited class. Instead, each path is constructed from a small set of waypoints that may be placed anywhere. We have devised a method that takes an arbitrary set of waypoint locations and adjusts their locations so that the resulting path meets travel time and maneuverability constraints. Using just 3 waypoints for each vehicle path, and applying a simple random search optimization algorithm to the waypoint locations, the final position uncertainty can be reduced by another factor of 3. Thus, we achieve a total factor of 15 reduction in position uncertainty when compared to the straight path (i.e. worst) case. Also, the results indicate that the final position uncertainty can be different for each vehicle. Furthermore, the navigation certainty does not necessarily improve with increased travel time. Thus, travel time should be considered a free parameter (i.e. the time constraint is not necessarily an active constraint). As is the case for most practical nonlinear optimization problems, there is no guarantee that the results obtained in this work are globally optimal. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that path planning can be used to significantly reduce navigation uncertainty for the scenario under consideration. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

It is still a challenge, however, to deal well with the surroundings that are both cluttered and highly dynamic. Planning under these conditions is more difficult for two reasons. First, tracking and predicting the trajectories ofmoving objects (i.e., cars, humans) is very noisy. Second, the planning process is computationally more expensive because of the increased dimensionality of the state-space, with time as an additional variable. Moreover, re-planning needs to be invoked more often since the trajectories of moving obstacles need to be constantly re-estimated.

    "[551 \t,0,0,\"Future self-driving cars and current ones with advanced driver assistance systems are expected to interact with other traffic participants, which often are multiple other vehicles. To facilitate the motion planning of the autonomously controlled vehicle in collision avoidance, individual object vehicles with closeness in positions and velocities can be grouped as a single extended moving object. However, due to uncertainties from sensor imperfections and environmental disturbances, the collision avoidance conditions are often expressed as difficult to resolve probabilistic constraints in the motion planning problem. In this paper, we propose a constraint tightening method to transform the probabilistic collision avoidance condition for a vehicle group or an extended object into a deterministic form. This is done via a conservative closed-form transformation of the bivariate integral in the collision probability density function and subsequent computable approximation with logistic functions. Detailed numerical experiments are included to illustrate the workings and the performance of the proposed approach.

Moreover, we convert the MP joining problem into a re-presentation problem and use the characteristics of the proposed representation algorithm to achieve an accurate and smooth transition. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively reduce the number of shape adjustment parameters when the MPs are regenerated without affecting the accuracy of the representation. Besides, we also present the ability of the proposed method to smooth the velocity jump when the MPs are connected and evaluate its effect on the accuracy of tracking the set target points. The results show that the proposed method can not only improve the adjustment ability of a single MP in response to different motion planning requirements but also meet the basic requirements of MP joining in the generation of MP sequences. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[580 \t,0,0,\"Human activities in maintenance of industrial plants pose elevated risks as well as significant costs due to the required shutdowns of the facility. An aerial robotic system with two arms for long reach manipulation in cluttered environments is presented to alleviate these constraints. The system consists of a multirotor with a long bar extension that incorporates a lightweight dual arm in the tip. This configuration allows aerial manipulation tasks even in hard-to-reach places. The objective of this work is the development of planning strategies to move the aerial robotic system with two arms for long reach manipulation in a safe and efficient way for both navigation and manipulation tasks. The motion planning problem is addressed considering jointly the aerial platform and the dual arm in order to achieve wider operating conditions. Since there exists a strong dynamical coupling between the multirotor and the dual arm, safety in obstacle avoidance will be assured by introducing dynamics awareness in the operation of the planner. On the other hand, the limited maneuverability of the system emphasizes the importance of energy and time efficiency in the generated trajectories. Accordingly, an adapted version of the optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm has been employed to guarantee their optimality. The resulting motion planning strategy has been evaluated through simulation in two realistic industrial scenarios, a riveting application and a chimney repairing task. To this end, the dynamics of the aerial robotic system with two arms for long reach manipulation has been properly modeled, and a distributed control scheme has been derived to complete the test bed. The satisfactory results of the simulations are presented as a first validation of the proposed approach. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.\"],\n",
    "[581 \t,0,0,\"Human drivers navigate by continuously predicting the intent of road users and interacting with them. For safe autonomous driving, research about predicting future trajectory of vehicles and motion planning based on these predictions has drawn attention in recent years. Most of these studies, however, did not take into account driver's intentions or any interdependence with other vehicles. In order to drive safely in real complex driving situations, it is essential to plan a path based on other driver's intentions and simultaneously to estimate the intentions of other road user with different characteristics as human drivers do. We aim to tackle the above challenges on highway merge scenario where the intention of other road users should be understood. In this study, we propose an intention aware motion planning method using finite state machine and model predictive control without any vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. The key idea is to design the behavioral planner that control the possible modes like human drivers do. This behavioral planner contains `negotiate` state which could inform my intent to other road users and estimate the other user's intention from their reaction. The model predictive controller generates an optimized trajectory for merging in terms of safety, efficiency and comfort with directly reflecting the estimated intention of the road users. In order to verify the proposed framework, the complex highway merging scenario is implemented where various road users with different intention and characteristic exist by using IDM (Intelligent Driver Model). © 2019 SAE International.

    "[583 \t,1,1,\"Human drivers take instant decisions about their speed, acceleration and distance from other vehicles based on different factors including their estimate of the road roughness. Having an accurate algorithm for real-time evaluation of road roughness can be critical for autonomous vehicles in order to achieve safe driving and passengers comfort. In this paper, we investigate the problem of interactive road roughness identification. We propose a novel inverse algorithm based on the knowledge of a vehicle dynamic characteristics and dynamic responses. The algorithm construct the road profile in time using one-iteration to update the wheels forces which are then used to identify the road roughness. The relation between the forces and the road profile is defined by a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved using the composite Gaussian quadrature. To reduce the error accumulation in time when noisy data is used for the vehicle response, a bidirectional filter is also implemented. We assume a simple model that is based on four degrees-of-freedom system and vibration acceleration measurements to evaluate the road roughness in real time. Although we present the results for this specific model, the algorithm can also be utilised with models of any number of degrees of freedom and can deal with models where the dynamic response is only available at some of the degrees of freedom. This is achieved by introducing a matrix reduction technique that is discussed in details. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of uncertainty in the vehicle parameters on the algorithm estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for different types of road roughness. The simulation results show that the proposed method is robust and can achieve high accuracy. The algorithm offers excellent potential for road roughness estimation not only for autonomous vehicle but also for vehicles and roads designing purposes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"],\n",

WAMI serves as a great source for many applications, including security, urban planning and route planning. These applications require fast and accurate image understanding which is time consuming for humans, due to the large data volume and city-scale area coverage. Therefore, automatic processing and understanding of WAMI imagery has been gaining attention in both industry and the research community. This paper focuses on an essential step in WAMI imagery analysis, namely vehicle classification. That is, deciding whether a certain image patch contains a vehicle or not. We collect a set of positive and negative sample image patches, for training and testing the detector. Positive samples are 64 × 64 image patches centered on annotated vehicles. We generate two sets of negative images. The first set is generated from positive images with some location shift. The second set of negative patches is generated from randomly sampled patches. We also discard those patches if a vehicle accidentally locates at the center. Both positive and negative samples are randomly divided into 9000 training images and 3000 testing images. We propose to train a deep convolution network for classifying these patches.

To draw the picture in detail, this paper designs a signal-free autonomous intersection with all-direction turn lanes (ADTL) under the environment of autonomous vehicles, and proposes a conflict-Avoidance-based approach to coordinate all approaching vehicles in different directions. Communicating with the approaching autonomous vehicles and utilizing the approach, the autonomous ADTL intersection is able to coordinate the approaching vehicles in all directions and guide them to safely and efficiently pass through the intersection. Two simulation scenarios are conducted in a road network with an isolated intersection composed of four three-lane arms. One scenario validates the collision-free design of the system, and the other shows that the designed ADTL intersection outperforms the conventional signal controlled intersection in terms of traffic efficiency, and is potentially better than the autonomous intersection with specific-direction turn lanes.

In the past, autonomous vehicle trajectory planning has not considered the related changes in the velocity of the vehicle. Therefore, the trajectory tracking control process has seldom considered the impact of curving paths on the trajectory tracking performance. To address these problems, this study evaluated an autonomous wheel loader based on the trajectory of its non-uniform driving motion and constructed an adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) trajectory tracking system that considers disturbances in the path curvature. The trajectory of the autonomous wheel loader was then tracked using the proposed AMPC system with a planned non-uniform motion trajectory as the target. Its performance was then compared with that of a conventional model predictive control (MPC) trajectory tracking system that does not consider any path curvature disturbances. The maximum displacement error and heading error obtained by the proposed AMPC system were found to be 65.7% and 60%, respectively, smaller than those obtained by the MPC system. The desired trajectory can also be tracked well under different curvature amplitudes using the AMPC trajectory tracking system, ensuring active safety performance of an autonomous wheel loader in the process of trajectory tracking. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

In this paper, we present a scenario based Model Predictive Control (MPC) trajectory planning algorithm that consists of spatial planning with embedded temporal optimization that leverages waypoints information of the road. Our trajectory planning algorithm is structured such that the spatial and temporal planning is integrated so that both the longitudinal and lateral aspects, reflected in the shape and length of the planned trajectory, are dynamically changing to best negotiate the constraints from road curvature and surrounding vehicles. The concept of a vehicle connected to shadow trolleys traveling along the rails on the road is introduced. Given waypoints, a reference cubic spline can be constructed to define the rail for trolleys and form a curvilinear coordinate. This concept facilitates the description of vehicle motion, trajectories, and surroundings with respect to the trolley, which is especially convenient for a vehicle traveling on high curvature road and switchbacks. A temporal optimization of the trolley instances is first conducted, which in turn allows us to make a proper approximation and reduce an originally complex nonlinear spatial-temporal optimization problem into one that requires only Quadratic Programming (QP).

    "[596 \t,0,0,\"In automatic parking motion planning, multi-objective optimization including safety, comfort, parking efficiency, and final parking performance should be considered. Most of the current research relies on the parking data from expert drivers or prior knowledge of humans. However, it is challenging to obtain a large amount of high-quality expert drivers' data. Furthermore, expert drivers' data or prior knowledge of humans does not guarantee an optimal multi-objective parking performance. In this article, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning method that learns parking policy of the data, by executing the data generation, data evaluation, and training network, iteratively. The trained network is used to guide the data generation cycle in the subsequent iteration. Based on this proposed method, we can get rid of human experience largely and learn parking strategies autonomously and quickly. The learned strategies ensure the multi-objective optimality of above requirements in the parking process. First, an environment model that approximates the actual environment is established, and the learning efficiency is accelerated through the simulated interaction between the agent and the environment model. To make the system independent of expert data or prior knowledge, a data generation algorithm combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and longitudinal and lateral policies is proposed. Then, to meet the multi-objective optimal demands mentioned above, a reward function is constructed to evaluate and filter the parking data. Finally, a neural network is used to learn the parking strategy from the filtered data.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based laser scanning (ULS) has the capability for efficient mapping, as it allows realizing higher flight velocities, higher flying altitude above ground level (AGL) and larger distances between neighbouring flight strips, compared to image based techniques. However, fully utilising the efficiency of the system in mission planning (especially for complex terrain projects, where occlusions and differently inclined surfaces are present) is prone to miss the project requirements in terms of point density and strip overlap. Therefore, the numerical simulation of point densities is a helpful tool for realizing a reliable planning of scan coverage. We implemented a ray-tracing-based ULS-simulator, specifically designed for emulating the mechanism of a Riegl VUX-1LR laser scanner carried by a Riegl RiCOPTER. The simulator can consider copter and scanner motion, which makes it possible to generate synthetic scan data excluding or including the aircraft movement due to aerodynamics by using either planned trajectories from a flight planning software or recorded and post-processed trajectories from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Laser shots are simulated by intersecting rays from the virtual scanner with a mesh-based digital surface model (DSM). The results show that the tool generates plausible synthetic laser point distributions. However, this is only the case, when aircraft aerodynamics are considered, as the effect of striping due to flight control corrections during the flight is very prominent. It can be shown that applying the presented tool for mission planning (without knowing the actual flight movements) has to consider an error margin of &plusmn;50pts/m2 in order to guarantee a compliance with the planned project requirements.

The main objective of GPP is to generate a collision free sub-optimal path with minimum path cost. The path is defined as a set of segments, passing through selected nodes known as waypoints. For smooth planar motion, the path cost is a function of the path length, the threat cost and the cost of diving. Path length is the total distance travelled from start to end point, threat cost is the penalty of collision with the obstacle and cost of diving is the energy expanse for diving deeper in ocean. This paper addresses the GPP problem for multiple AUVs in formation. Here, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is used to find the suboptimal path for multiple AUVs in formation. The results obtained are compared to the results of applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the same problem. GA concept is simple to understand, easy to implement and supports multi-objective optimization. It is robust to local minima and have wide applications in various fields of science, engineering and commerce. Hence, GA is used for this comparative study. The performance analysis is based on computational time, length of the path generated and the total path cost. The resultant path obtained using GWO is found to be better than GA in terms of path cost and processing time. Thus, GWO is used as the GPP algorithm for three AUVs in formation. The formation follows leader-follower topography. A sliding mode controller (SMC) is developed to minimize the tracking error based on local information while maintaining formation, as mild communication exists. The stability of the sliding surface is ver- ified by Lyapunov stability analysis. With proper path planning, the path cost can be minimized as AUVs can reach their target in less time with less energy expanses. Thus, lower path cost leads to less expensive underwater missions.

    "[607 \t,0,0,\"In many traffic situations there are times where interaction with other drivers is necessary and unavoidable in order to safely progress towards an intended destination. This is especially true for merge manoeuvres into dense traffic, where drivers sometimes must be somewhat aggressive and show the intention of merging in order to interact with the other driver and make the driver open the gap needed to execute the manoeuvre safely. Many motion planning frameworks for autonomous vehicles adopt a reactive approach where simple models of other traffic participants are used and therefore need to adhere to large margins in order to behave safely. However, the large margins needed can sometimes get the system stuck in congested traffic where time gaps between vehicles are too small. In other situations, such as a highway merge, it can be significantly more dangerous to stop on the entrance ramp if the gaps are found to be too small than to make a slightly more aggressive manoeuvre and let the driver behind open the gap needed. To remedy this problem, this work uses the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to explicitly model the interaction of other drivers and evaluates the risk by their required deceleration in a similar manner as the Minimum Overall Breaking Induced by Lane change (MOBIL) model that has been used in large scale traffic simulations before. This allows the algorithm to evaluate the effect on other drivers depending on our own trajectory plans by simulating the nearby traffic situation. Finding a globally optimal solution is often intractable in these situations so instead a large set of candidate trajectories are generated that are evaluated against the traffic scene by forward simulations of other traffic participants. By discretization and using an efficient trajectory generator together with efficient modelling of the traffic scene real-Time demands can be met. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

Firstly, a standard coordinate turn process model is deduced as the existence of translation and rotation of the vehicle on the two-dimensional ground plane. Secondly, an unscented Kalman filter algorithm is developed due to the nonlinear radar measurement model. Thirdly, a priority data association rule, which puts the targets in a priority queue according to the number of times they are associated, is designed to filter out noise, given that it is unlikely for a vehicle target as an inertial system to appear or disappear instantly in practice. In addition, the data association rule specifies that the closer the target is to the front of the queue, the more prioritized the association with the newly observed target would be. Finally, the track management algorithm is constructed. On this basis, a series of real vehicle tests were conducted on real roads with four typical scenarios.

The quintic Bézier curve was used to approximate the lane line in the winding road scene to obtain the reference path. Through the arc-length parameterization of reference path, a curvilinear coordinate system was established by using the arc-length as abscissa and the lateral offset as ordinate. According to the position of the vehicle and the sub-target points in the curvilinear coordinate system, the candidate paths were generated by the cubic polynomial in real time, and the candidate paths were optimized by using the sequence quadratic planning method. In order to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithm, an electric vehicle was used as a platform to build a test car with monocular cameras, 64-line laser radar, industrial control computers and other equipments. The online simulation of vehicle obstacle avoidance algorithm in the winding road scene was implemented based on Apollo platform. During the real vehicle experiment in the zone, the GPS position error and heading angle cumulative error of the obstacle avoidance algorithm were analyzed. Research result shows that the obstacle avoidance path planning of vehicle in the winding road scene can effectively describe the information of path curvature radius, the offset distance of vehicle center from the lane line, etc, and it is easy to determine the driving area of the vehicle and the obstacle position information ahead, so as to generate the optimal path. During the obstacle avoidance in the zone, the GPS position error occurs at the initial point, turning point and obstacle avoidance point, the maximum error is 0.15 m, and the heading angle cumulative error is 12°. The sudden increase of curve position error is mainly caused by the instantaneous change of vehicle posture and the matching process of obstacles, but the error can be well controlled within a certain range.

After searching and evaluating the accessible free sectors based on a cost function, the optimal paths were selected. In view of the different vehicle conditions at different time, a risk assessment function was established based on the distance between congested area and the autonomous vehicle, and the current vehicle speed to guarantee the optimal path with no collision. The fuzzy control was established, on the basis of driving behaviors, regarding the risk assessment value and angle into the optimal sector as the input, and angular velocity and the linear velocity of vehicles as the output. Meanwhile, with the global path known, the sub-target was selected for the real-time local path planning on the global path. On account of the influence of environment and other factors, the sub-target was classified into the place blocked by the unknown area, somewhere obstructed by the known congested area with visible sub-target and somewhere blocked by known area with invisible sub-target. In order to guide the autonomous vehicles, the state of each sub-target was analyzed respectively, and vehicles should move forward at the certain speed in a certain direction.

    "[666 \t,0,0,\"In some restricted urban parking environment, conventional automatic parking assist system (APAS) may not be applicable due to the dimension limitations of the parking lot. To handle these situations, a novel ASPS for four-wheel steering (4WS) vehicles is proposed in this paper. In the proposed novel APAS, the suitable parking space is first identified through low-cost ultrasonic sensors mounted around the vehicle. Then, depending on the vehicle initial position, various compact and smooth parking paths are generated. With the full utilization of the 4WS system, the proposed path planning algorithm can allow a larger initial parking area and generate simple 2 or 2 segments plus parking paths, which can be easily tracked by the 4WS vehicles. The proposed APAS for 4WS vehicles makes the automatic parking process in restricted spaces more efficient. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed APAS, a 4WS vehicle prototype is applied for validations through both simulation and experiment results. Copyright © 2019 ASME.\"],\n",

We explore an architecture-aware algorithmic approach to reduce data movement and the resulting latency and power consumption. This article presents an attention-based feedback for controlling input data, referred to as the activation pruning, that reduces activation maps in early layers of a DNN network which are critical for reducing data movement in real-time AI processing. The proposed approach is demonstrated for coupling RGB and Lidar images to perform real-time perception and local motion planning in autonomous systems. Lidar data is used to determine 'Pixels of Interest'(PoI) in an RGB image depending on their distance from sensor, prune the RGB image to perform object detection only within the PoI, and use the detected objects to perform local motion planning. Experiments on sequences from KITTI dataset shows the activation pruning maintains quality of motion planning while increasing the sparsity of the activation maps. The sparsity-aware computing architectures is considered to leverage activation sparsity for improved performance. The simulation results show that proposed activation pruning algorithm reduces data movement (38.5%), computational load (30.1%), and memory latency (76.3%) in sparsity-aware compute architecture, leading to faster perception and lower energy consumption. © 2011 IEEE.\"],\n",

Similar to the driving preference of human, the driving path and speed can be determined separately. This paper is concerned with speed profile optimisation problem for dynamic obstacle avoidance given the reference path. The optimisation consists of smoothness, risk, and efficiency terms with obstacle constraints. For task formulation, the s-t motion space is constructed to describe the motion of the ego vehicle and obstacles. Then the high-dimensional trajectory space is mapped to the low-dimensional s-t space for computational efficiency. The speed optimisation problem is transformed into a path searching problem considering collision avoidance and searching efficiency. RRT-based algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal speed profile in the s-t space asymptotically. In each searching step, node extension strategy is designed for the space exploring efficiency; then the tree structure is locally refined for asymptotic optimisation. The optimal speed profile is generated after the searching process converges and the speed profile is planned periodically.

However, if the road slope is measured by the sensor while the commercial vehicle is driving, the vibration of the vehicle body will affect its measurement accuracy. Therefore, the relevant algorithm is used to estimate the real-time slope of the road when the commercial vehicle is driving. At present, many domestic and foreign scholars have analyzed and tested the estimation of road slope by the least square method or Kalman filter algorithm. Although the two methods both can achieve the estimation, the real-time performance and accuracy still need to be improved. In this paper, for traditional fuel commercial vehicle, the Kalman filter algorithm based on the kinematics and the extended Kalman filter algorithm based on the longitudinal dynamics are respectively used to estimate the road slope. In the process of estimation based on kinematics, considering the influence of road slope rate to estimate, the recursive least squares method with forgetting factor is used to estimate the road slope rate.Finally, the estimation results obtained by kinematics and dynamics are combined. It is expected that the error based on the algorithm-estimated slope value and the true slope value will be within 6% after the commercial vehicle is driving.

We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with moving obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in conjunction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesizing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles.

    "[700 \t,1,1,\"In this paper a combined longitudinal and lateral trajectory planning approach is presented using an linear-time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) scheme. To consider uncertain moving object state and prediction information, an adaptive potential field is modelled generating a time-varying obstacle cost-term. Approximating the nonlinear planning problem along the previous planned control and state sequence results in an LTV-MPC planning problem and ensures small approximation errors of the original nonlinear formulation. The proposed LTV-MPC planning approach is analyzed in a collision avoidance scenario with a pedestrian. The results show a more defensive maneuver integrating the uncertain object prediction information in the planning problem and the proposed approximation scheme delivers a difference of 492, 18 % in the relative approximation error of the cost function in the presented scenario compared to the widely used approach, approximating the planning problem by using the current vehicle state. © 2020 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[701 \t,1,1,\"In this paper a path tracking control for an autonomous vehicle is developed using the H? technique. The lateral control problem is reformulated as the control of two variables: The lateral error and the derivative of the look-ahead error, defined as the distance between a virtual point on the vehicle longitudinal axis in front of the CoG and the reference trajectory. This approach is based on the fact that while driving on a constant curvature trajectory the derivative of the look-ahead error must be 0. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated with experiments on a 2013 Dodge Dart equipped with throttle, brake and steer-by-wire system and in simulation on CarSim. A model of the vehicle is identified, validated by experimental tests and used to tune the simulator. The steering actuator dynamics is also taken into account since it significantly affects the dynamics of the total system. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

In order to reduce excessive slip effects between robot wheels and ground it is assumed that the vehicle moves with bounded velocities and accelerations.

To account for practical motion tasks the trajectory tracking algorithm is complemented by a motion planner, which utilizes the differential flatness property of unicycle-like kinematics. During the motion planning stage an auxiliary trajectory connecting points in the configuration space and satisfying assumed phase constraints is generated.

    "[704 \t,0,0,\"In this paper we are interested in area monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Basically, we propose a path planning approach for area monitoring where UAVs are considered as mobile collectors. The area to be monitored is divided into cells. The goal is to determine the path of each UAV such that each cell is covered by exactly one UAV, fairness is ensured in terms of the number of cells visited by each UAV and the path of each UAV is minimized. To meet our goal, we proceed in two steps. In the first step, we assign to each UAV the cells to visit. In the second step, we optimize the path of each UAV visiting its cells. For the first step, we propose two solutions. The first solution is based on cluster formation, each cluster is made up of the set of cells monitored by a same UAV. The second solution is based on game theory and uses coalition formation to determine the cells to be monitored by each UAV. In the second step and for both solutions, we propose to apply optimization techniques to minimize the path of each UAV that visits all its cells. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

Due to operating in the same environment, the interaction between the cars must be taken into account, and can induce further delays. We propose an integrated route and motion planning approach that achieves scalability with respect to the number of cars by resolving potential collision situations locally within so-called bubble spaces enclosing the conflict. The algorithms leverage the road geometries, and perform joint planning only for lead vehicles in the conflict and use queue scheduling for the remaining cars. Furthermore, a framework for storing previously resolved conflict situations is proposed, which can be use for quick querying of joint motion plans.

    "[707 \t,0,0,\"In this paper we deal with an overtaking and lane change strategy for autonomous vehicles. The algorithm is divided into two main layers. The upper layer is responsible for the decision making (e.g lane changing). Before decision-making we predict the motion of other participants and divide the road into discrete sets in each interval, then we compute the probability of occupancy. Considering the state of the motion of ego vehicle we can compute the probability of collision. After assigning a graph points to discrete elements, the probability of collision is ordered to the graph edges, then we determine the route with the smallest cost. The decision-making algorithm is not able to control the vehicle, so it is necessary to design a traceable trajectory for the vehicle. Since we have a series of points to be reached for the future, this can be used as a reference vector for the trajectory design algorithm. One Model Predicitve Controller (MPC) is responsible for the design of the trajectory so we can obtain limitations to several states to ensure comfort and security. Extending the algorithm, we can compute the longitudinal movement as well.

There are many traffic situations in urban scenarios where nontrivial maneuvering in narrow places is necessary.

Our approach consists of a global planner which generates a preliminary path consisting of straight and turning-in-place primitives and a local planner which is used to make the preliminary path feasible to car-like vehicles. The approximation methodology is well known in the literature; however, both components proposed in this paper differ from existing similar planning methods. The approximation process with the proposed local planner is proven to be convergent for any preliminary global paths.

Secondly, we propose an improvement for operations in unexplored or partially known environments by endowing the planner with a tree pruning procedure, which maintains a valid and feasible search-tree during operation. When the robot senses new obstacles in the environment that invalidate its current path, the planner prunes the tree of branches which collides with the environment. The path planning algorithm is then initialised with the pruned tree, enabling it to find a solution in a lower time than replanning from scratch. We present results obtained through simulation which show that HA* performs better in known underwater environments than compared algorithms in regards to planning time, path length and success rate. For unknown environments, we show that the tree pruning procedure reduces the total planning time needed in a variety of environments compared to running the full planning algorithm during replanning. © 2021 by the authors.

To overcome the complex calculations subject to HJB, a method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), called ADP is implemented.

The DSSD extends the concept of shell-space decomposition (SSD) by generating multiple sets of shells radiating out from the starting position of each vehicle to the rendezvous destination, enabling each vehicle to generate its trajectory within its own SSD subset. This scheme is combined with an optimized mass-center rendezvous-point selection scheme, together with a B-spline-based quantum particle swarm optimization technique to find optimal rendezvous trajectories for multiple AMVs with minimal travel time and simultaneous time of arrival for all the participating vehicles. The path planner identifies the optimal rendezvous location and generates the corresponding rendezvous trajectories based on the capabilities of each vehicle and the dynamics of the ocean environment. Simulation results show that the proposed DSSD method, combined with a novel optimized mass-center rendezvous-point selection scheme, is able to find trajectories for multiple AMVs that ensure that they reach their common destination simultaneously and with optimized time/energy consumption. A set of representative Monte Carlo simulations were run to analyze the performance of these path planners for multiple AMVs rendezvous.

    "[730 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, a general formulation of a predictive and multirate (MR) reactive planning method for intelligent vehicles (IVs) is introduced. The method handles path planning and trajectory planning for IVs in dynamic environments with uncertainty, in which the kinodynamic vehicle constraints are also taken into account. It is based on the potential field projection method (PFP), which combines the classical potential field (PF) method with the MR Kalman filter estimation. PFP takes into account the future object trajectories and their associated uncertainties, which makes it different from other look-ahead approaches. Here, a new PF is included in the Lagrange-Euler formulation in a natural way, accounting for the vehicle dynamics. The resulting accelerations are translated into control inputs that are considered in the estimation process. This leads to the generation of a local trajectory in real time (RT) that fully meets the constraints imposed by the kinematic and dynamic models of the IV. The properties of the method are demonstrated by simulation with MATLAB and C++ applications. Very good performance and execution times are achieved, even in challenging situations.

We first formulate the motion planning problem of an AGV with static and dynamic obstacles as a nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP). Subsequently, a direct method incorporating a smooth transformation technique is utilized to obtain the high-fidelity optimal solutions off-line. The optimal state-action samples are then extracted from the optimal trajectories generated by the OCP from perturbed initial states and stored as a large optimal trajectory data set. Thereafter, the DNNs architecture is designed and trained off-line through the collected data set to learn the optimal state-action relationship. As a result, the well-trained DNNs are used to produce the corresponding to optimal feedback actions on-board. The main advantage of our approach is that the time-consuming computation process is only carried out off-line and thus the traditional repeated off-line planning for the AGV due to changes such as the perturbed initial conditions in the system can be effectively avoided. Numerical experimental results are carried out to demonstrate our designed DNNs-based optimal control approach can generate the optimal control instructions on-board to steer the AGV to the desired location with high robustness to initial conditions as well as satisfying different obstacle constraints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

The purpose of the proposed method is to improve the robustness of autonomous robot motion planning capabilities within dynamic, uncertain environments by integrating a virtual plane-based reactive motion planning technique with a sensor fusion-based obstacle detection approach. The dynamic reactive motion planning method assumes a local observer in the virtual plane, which allows the effective transformation of complex dynamic planning problems into simple stationary ones proving the speed and orientation information between the robot and obstacles. In addition, the sensor fusion-based obstacle detection technique allows the pose estimation of moving obstacles using a Kinect sensor and sonar sensors, thus improving the accuracy and robustness of the reactive motion planning approach. The performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through not only simulation studies but also field experiments using multiple moving obstacles in hostile dynamic environments. © 2015 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.\"],\n",

    "[759 \t,1,1,\"In this paper, an urban-based path planning algorithm that considered multiple obstacles and road constraints in a university campus environment with an autonomous micro electric vehicle (micro-EV) is studied. Typical path planning algorithms, such as A*, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random tree* (RRT*), take a single arrival point, resulting in a lane departure situation on the high curved roads. Further, these could not consider urban-constraints to set collision-free obstacles. These problems cause dangerous obstacle collisions. Additionally, for drive stability, real-time operation should be guaranteed. Therefore, an urban-based online path planning algorithm, which is robust in terms of a curved-path with multiple obstacles, is proposed. The algorithm is constructed using two methods, A* and an artificial potential field (APF). To validate and evaluate the performance in a campus environment, autonomous driving systems, such as vehicle localization, object recognition, vehicle control, are implemented in the micro-EV. Moreover, to confirm the algorithm stability in the complex campus environment, hazard scenarios that complex obstacles can cause are constructed. These are implemented in the form of a delivery service using an autonomous driving simulator, which mimics the Chungbuk National University (CBNU) campus. © 2021 by the authors.

A motion planner is combined with a scheduler allowing each AGV to update its destination resource during navigation in order to complete the transported product.

The first step consists in planning a presumed trajectory to avoid collision conflicts previously detected by a central supervisor, enabling more appropriate decentralized scheduling by AGVs. The presumed trajectories, which represent the intentions of AGVs, are then exchanged with neighboring AGVs. The second step uses the presumed trajectories of neighbors to compute a collision-free trajectory according to the priority policy.

    "[762 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, optimal three-dimensional paths are generated offline for waypoint guidance of a miniature Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Having the starting point, the destination point, and the position and dimension of the obstacles, the AUV is intended to systematically plan an optimal path toward the target. The path is defined as a set of waypoints to be passed by the vehicle. Four criteria are considered for evaluation of an optimal path; they are `total length of path`, `margin of safety`, `smoothness of the planar motion` and `gradient of diving`. A set of Pareto-optimal solutions is found where each solution represents an optimal feasible path that cannot be outrun by any other path considering all four criteria. Then, a proposed three-dimensional guidance system is used for guidance of the AUV through selected optimal paths. This system is inspired from the Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance strategy; the idea is to select the desired depth, presumed proportional to the horizontal distance of the AUV and the target. To develop this guidance strategy, the dynamic modeling of this novel miniature AUV is also derived.

At the beginning of the planning horizon list of orders is processed in the manufacturing system. The produced or semi-produced products are carried among stations using AGVs according to the process plan and the earliest delivery time rule. Thus, a network of stations and AGV paths is configured. The guide path is bi-direction and AGVs can only stop at the end of a node. Two kinds of collisions exist namely: AGVs move directly to a same node and AGVs are on a same path. Delay is defined as an order is carried after the earliest delivery time. Therefore, the problem is defined to consider some AGVs and material handling orders available and assign orders to AGVs so that collision free paths as cost attribute and minimal waiting time as time attribute, are obtained. Solving this problem leads to determine: the number of required AGVs for orders fulfillment assign orders to AGVs schedule delivery and material handling and route different AGVs.

The proposed mathematical formulation is first adapted to a minimum cost flow (MCF) model and then optimized using a modified network simplex algorithm (NSA).

A variant of the minimum cost network flow approach, which is referred to as label-setting greedy-based algorithm, is then applied to this problem. Using the digital terrain elevation data and discrete dynamic equations of motion, an optimal four-dimensional trajectory (three spatial and one time dimensions) from a source to a destination is obtained deterministically by minimizing a nonlinear cost functional subject to dynamic and mission constraints of the unmanned aerial vehicle. For each arc in the grid, a cost functional is considered as a combination of the path length, fuel consumption, flight time, and risk-of-threat region.

    "[773 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, the traditional shortest path planning problem for vehicle is advanced to length-targeted path planning problem, i.e., to plan path with its length being as close to a specified value as possible. Lengthening and shortening of given initial paths are used to solve this problem. Based on an operation set consisting of three basic path homotopies, we build a comprehensive and systematic framework to plan paths with target length, which is a generalization of the existing related studies. Thereby, the expected paths can be independently searched through such deformation processes within topological classes. The proposed framework can produce the largest length coverage in different scenarios and under different conditions, and it can also generate expected paths with arbitrary topological classification in terms of the curvature constraint and the obstacle constraint. Examples show that our lengthening and shortening method can effectively solve the length-targeted path planning problem in environment without or with obstacles. Note to Practitioners - This paper presents a curvature-bounded lengthening and shortening approach for path planning of vehicles. The curvature and obstacle constraints in the path planning problem are handled using the topological technique. In addition, a rigorous classification system is presented to systematically categorize the potential paths. Within a path class, any path can be deformed to other paths while keeping the curvature bounded. Then, the path deformation process is conducted via a series of basic homotopy operations to approach the target length. The length coverage range of this process is reduced when some endpoint conditions are meet or the vehicle is trapped into a closed region. © 2004-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",

We are interested in the energy-aware (both motion and communication energy) co-optimization of robotic paths and transmission powers for cooperative transmit beamforming under a reception quality requirement. We first consider the case where the channel is known. For this case, we propose an efficient approach for getting arbitrarily close to the optimum solution, which involves solving a series of multiple-choice knapsack problems. We then extend our analysis and methodology to the case where the channel is not known. The robots then probabilistically predict the channel at unvisited locations and integrate it with path planning and decision making for energy-aware distributed transmit beamforming. Finally, we extensively confirm our proposed approach with several simulation results with real channel parameters.

    "[781 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we consider an anti-jamming problem for one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reaching a given destination with maintaining the communication quality, where the ground-to-air communication link is spatially affected by an adversarial jammer. Note that the jammer's position and transmit power are initially unknown. To solve this problem, we propose a jammer detection-localization-evasion framework. Firstly, we employ a jammer detection method combining the Received Signal Strength (RSS) with Packet Error Rate (PER). After the jammer is detected, our designed RSS based jammer localization algorithm is presented, which can estimate the jammer position and jamming signal power simultaneously. However, localization noises often exist in practical scenarios, and therefore the estimated jammer information is usually with uncertainties. To overcome these uncertainties, we propose a robust path planning method of successful jammer evasion. More specifically, the proposed method can guarantee the worst-case performance so that the communication quality can be always better than a certain level under all possible uncertainties. Finally, a UAV communication jammed model is built on Network Simulator (NS3) and corroborates the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

Attention is focused on the case of a deterministic steady OGCM field, which is used to specify data for both the ocean current and for ocean bathymetry. A general framework for optimal trajectory planning is developed for this setting, accounting for the 3D ocean current and for static obstacle avoidance constraints. A nonlinear programming approach is used for this purpose, which leads to a low complexity discrete-time model that can be efficiently solved. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model, we consider the optimal time trajectory planning of an AUV operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, with velocity, and bathymetric data provided by an eddy-resolving MITgcm. Different optimal-time trajectory planning scenarios are implemented to demonstrate the capabilities of the model to identify trajectories that adapt to favorable and adverse currents and to avoid obstacles corresponding to a complex bathymetry environment.

The T?-Lite algorithm is a significantly faster version of the previously developed T? algorithm. T?-Lite uses the novel time-risk cost function of T?; however, instead of a grid-based approach, it uses an asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planner. Furthermore, it utilizes the recently developed Generalized Multi-speed Dubins Motion-model (GMDM) for sample-to-sample kinodynamic motion planning. The sample-based approach and GMDM significantly reduce the computational burden of T? while providing reasonable solution quality. The sample points are drawn from a four-dimensional configuration space consisting of two position coordinates plus vehicle heading and speed. Specifically, T?- Lite enables the motion planner to select the vehicle speed and direction based on its proximity to the obstacle to generate faster and safer paths. In this paper, T?-Lite is developed using the RRT? motion planner, but adaptation to other motion planners is straightforward and depends on the needs of the planner. © 2020 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[790 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we develop new motion models for curvature-constrained and variable-speed Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for time-optimal risk-aware motion planning. AUVs are becoming increasingly useful and cost-effective for a variety of tasks in many underwater applications including surveillance and scientific expeditions. Despite recent advances, the autonomy of AUVs is limited, especially for vehicles that operate in environments with obstacles. In particular, there is limited research for time-optimal risk-aware motion planning. In contrast, there has been significant research for finding the time-optimal paths in environments without obstacles; however, adapting these models to environments with obstacles yields sub-optimal results, since these models force the AUV to operate at extremal speeds at close proximity to obstacles. Specifically, moving at maximum speed increases the risk of collision, while moving at minimum speed dramatically increases travel time. As such, this paper presents new motion models for AUVs that enable the selection of intermediate speeds to provide a better balance between time and risk near obstacles. These models enhance the agility and maneuverability of the AUV and provide motion planners the flexibility to select appropriate speeds and therefore construct time-optimal risk-aware paths. Additionally, the models are simple to compute and are suitable for on-demand real-time computation. The performance of the proposed model is compared against existing models using our recently developed T? algorithm for time-optimal risk-aware motion planning. The results show that our new model yields paths that are shorter in obstacles-rich scenarios with substantially lower risks. © 2019 Marine Technology Society.\"],\n",

The Dubins TSP is a variant of the combinatorial TSP for curvature-constrained vehicles. The problem is to determine a cost efficient path to visit a given set of continuous regions while the path allows to satisfy kinematic constraints of non-holonomic vehicles. The k-DTSPN is a generalization to determine k such paths, one for each vehicle. Although the k-DTSPN has been addressed by evolutionary methods, the proposed approach is able to provide solutions very quickly in units of seconds on conventional computationally resources which makes the proposed SOM-based approach suitable for on-line planning. The studied problem is motivated by surveillance task in which it is required to quickly provide information about the given set of target locations. Therefore, real computational requirements are crucial properties of the desired k-DTSPN solver.

    "[793 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we focus on dynamic trajectory planning for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Specifically, we are interested in planning the trajectory of an AUV as it returns to a moving recovery vessel. To aid in this task, the AUV is equipped with a passive, angle-only, sensor to enable localization of the recovery vessel. Accordingly, we present an algorithm that is capable of dynamically updating the trajectory of the AUV given measurement data from the passive sensor. Our approach is based on adapting a static trajectory planning algorithm from robotics, known as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT?), to allow for localization and tracking of a dynamic target (i.e. the recovery vessel). In contrast to dynamic programming or fixed grid trajectory planning, the RRT? offers a computationally efficient method for long-term trajectory planning with probabilistic guarantees of optimality. In this framework, we explore two options: trajectory planning based on minimising the distance to the target; and trajectory planning based on maximising the tracking accuracy of the target using an information theoretic cost. Using AUV recovery as an evaluation scenario, we analyse and evaluate the proposed trajectory planning algorithm against traditional dynamic programming methods.

    "[800 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we present a bilevel optimal motion planning (BOMP) model for autonomous parking. The BOMP model treats motion planning as an optimal control problem, in which the upper level is designed for vehicle nonlinear dynamics, and the lower level is for geometry collision-free constraints. The significant feature of the BOMP model is that the lower level is a linear programming problem that serves as a constraint for the upper-level problem. That is, an optimal control problem contains an embedded optimization problem as constraints. Traditional optimal control methods cannot solve the BOMP problem directly. Therefore, the modified approximate Karush–Kuhn–Tucker theory is applied to generate a general nonlinear optimal control problem. Then the pseudospectral optimal control method solves the converted problem. Particularly, the lower level is the J2-function that acts as a distance function between convex polyhedron objects. Polyhedrons can approximate objects in higher precision than spheres or ellipsoids. As a result, a fast high-precision BOMP algorithm for autonomous parking concerning dynamical feasibility and collision-free property is proposed. Simulation results and experiment on Turtlebot3 validate the BOMP model, and demonstrate that the computation speed increases almost two orders of magnitude compared with the area criterion based collision avoidance method. © 2019, The Author(s).\"],\n",
    "[801 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we present a collaborative path-planning framework for a group of micro aerial vehicles that are capable of localizing through vision. Each of the micro aerial vehicles is assumed to be equipped with a forward facing monocular camera. The vehicles initially use their captured images to build 3D maps through common features; and subsequently track these features to localize through 3D-2D correspondences. The planning algorithm, while connecting start locations to provided goal locations, also aims to reduce the localization uncertainty of the vehicles in the group. To achieve this, we develop a two-step planning framework: the first step attempts to build an improved map of the environment by solving the next-best-view problem for multiple cameras. We express this as a black-box optimization problem and solve it using the Covariance Matrix Adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Once an improved map is available, the second stage of the planning framework performs belief space planning for the vehicles individually using the rapidly exploring random belief tree (RRBT) algorithm. Through the RRBT approach, the planner generates paths that ensure feature visibility while attempting to optimize path cost and reduce localization uncertainty. We validate our approach using experiments conducted in a high visual-fidelity aerial vehicle simulator, Microsoft AirSim. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[802 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we present a motion planning algorithm for autonomous navigation in highly constrained urban environments. Since common approaches to on-road trajectory planning turned out to be unsuitable for this task, we instead extended an A?-based planner originally designed for navigation in unstructured environments. Two novel node expansion methods were added to obtain smooth and accurate trajectories that consider the structure of the environment. The first one attempts to find a trajectory connecting the current node directly to the goal by solving a boundary value problem using numerical optimization. The second method leverages a simulated pure-pursuit controller to generate edges (i.e. short motion primitives) that guide the vehicle toward or along the global reference path. As a result, the planner is able to produce smooth paths while retaining the explorative power of A? that is needed to deal with challenging situations in urban driving (e.g., reversing in order to pass a vehicle that stopped unexpectedly). Its practical usefulness was demonstrated during extensive tests on an electric vehicle navigating a mock urban environment as well as on our own autonomous vehicle MuCAR-3. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

Existing motion planning algorithms in artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with complex and dynamic continuous underwater environments prone to currents.

First, we develop an algorithm called Hybrid Search Fast Marching (HSFM) method, which gives consideration to both total path cost and computational time, to efficiently generate a 3D continuous smooth path from a discrete representation of underwater environments. Second, we develop a novel anisotropic FM algorithm to deal with underwater currents based on the geometric relationships between characteristic lines and gradient lines in speed profiles. Third, we introduce multiple decision criteria and constraints in complex and dynamic underwater environments such as currents, dynamic obstacles, reefs, shoals and navigation rules in motion planning process. Extensive random simulations for an AUV sail planning task show that the HSFM algorithm meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds continuous smooth paths of better cost in shorter time compared to the MSA? and A? algorithms.\"],\n",
    "[804 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we present a novel control law for longitudinal speed control of autonomous vehicles. The key contributions of the proposed work include the design of a control law that reactively integrates the longitudinal surface gradient of the road into its operation. In contrast to the existing works, we found that integrating the path gradient into the control framework improves the speed tracking efficacy. Since the control law is implemented over a shrinking domain scheme, it minimizes the integrated error by recomputing the control inputs at every discretized step and consequently provides less reaction time. This makes our control law suitable for motion planning frameworks that are operating at high frequencies. Furthermore, our work is implemented using a generalized vehicle model and can be easily extended to other classes of vehicles. The performance of gradient aware - shrinking domain based controller is implemented and tested on an electric car. Results from the tests show the robustness of our control law for speed tracking efficiency on terrain with varying gradient while also considering stringent time constraints imposed by the planning framework. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

    "[809 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we present an algorithm for decentralized control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing transportation tasks within industrial and warehousing environments. By running on each vehicle in the system, the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous path planning and motion co-ordination. The path planning part of the algorithm implements a free-ranging motion scheme by determining the shortest feasible paths considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints. The motion co-ordination part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions by reliable detection and resolution of different conflict situations with other vehicles in the shared workspace. Conflict resolution is based on a vehicle priority scheme and results in temporary stopping or removal of the lower priority vehicles taking part in the conflict. Removal action is always performed within the vehicle's private zone, i.e., the pre-allocated local region of the workspace surrounding the vehicle. By encoding information on the vehicle size and its kinematic constraints, the introduced private zone mechanism provides the necessary physical space required for successful execution of every removal action. We also analyze the stability of the presented algorithm and discuss its deadlock-free and livelock-free properties. Algorithm performance has been validated by simulation using ten vehicles and experimentally on two different setups-a laboratory setup comprising five Pioneer 3DX vehicles and by two state-of-the-art autonomous forklifts in industrial-like operating conditions. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

We reduce the complexity of the 3D planning problem to that of a 2D planning problem by leveraging regulatory restrictions and guidelines as well as mission-specific boundary conditions to simplify the configuration space. This is achieved through strict limitations and a projection of the search space into a quasi-2D plane.

    "[819 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we propose a cooperative motion planning method for a group of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) crossing a lane-free intersection without using explicit traffic signaling. This multi-vehicle motion planning task is formulated as a centralized optimal control problem. However, the solution to this optimal control problem is numerically intractable due to the high dimensionality of the collision-avoidance constraints and the nonlinearity of the vehicle kinematics. A two-stage strategy is proposed for generating online solutions: at Stage 1, the CAVs are requested to reach a standard formation before entering the intersection; at Stage 2, the vehicles cross the intersection. As the motion planning sub-problem at Stage 2 begins with a standard configuration, the optimal solution to this standard sub-problem can be computed offline in advance and applied online directly. On the other hand, the formation reconfiguration sub-problem at Stage 1 is easy to solve online. Through dividing the entire dynamic process into two periods, the difficulties in the original optimal control problem are significantly reduced so that the real-time performance is achieved. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[821 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we propose a framework for generating motion primitives for lattice-based motion planners automatically. Given a family of systems, the user only needs to specify which principle types of motions, which are here denoted maneuvers, that are relevant for the considered system family. Based on the selected maneuver types and a selected system instance, the algorithm not only automatically optimizes the motions connecting pre-defined boundary conditions, but also simultaneously optimizes the end-point boundary conditions as well. This significantly reduces the time consuming part of manually specifying all boundary value problems that should be solved, and no exhaustive search to generate feasible motions is required. In addition to handling static a priori known system parameters, the framework also allows for fast automatic reoptimization of motion primitives if the system parameters change while the system is in use, e.g, if the load significantly changes or a trailer with a new geometry is picked up by an autonomous truck. We also show in several numerical examples that the framework can enhance the performance of the motion planner in terms of total cost for the produced solution. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

The MAP framework consists of two levels, namely, centralized mission planning and decentralized motion planning. On the first level, the centralized mission planning algorithm estimates the density of UAV in a given environment for determining the number of UGVs and their initial operating location. In the subsequent level, a decentralized motion planning algorithm which provides a closed-form expression for velocity command using adaptive density estimation has been proposed. Further, the physical and geographical constraints are integrated into motion planning. A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the advantages of the MAP over distributed stationary stations (DSSs) often used in the literature. The obtained results clearly indicate that in comparison with DSS, MAP reduces the average distance traveled by UAVs about 20%, reduces the loss of mission time by 90 s per interruption and power loss by 3 dB. © 2013 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[823 \t,1,1,\"In this paper, we propose a new model predictive control (MPC) formulation for autonomous driving. The novelty of our MPC stems from the following results. Firstly, we adopt an alternating minimization approach wherein linear velocities and angular accelerations are alternately optimized. We show that in contrast to the joint optimization, the alternating minimization exploits the structure of the problem better, which in turn translates to reduction in computation time. Secondly, our MPC explicitly incorporates the time dependent non-linear actuator dynamics that captures the transient response of the vehicle for a given commanded velocity. This added complexity improves the predictive component of MPC resulting in improved margin of inter-vehicle distance during maneuvers like overtaking, lane-change, etc. Although, past works have also incorporated actuator dynamics within MPC, there has been very few attempts towards coupling actuator dynamics to collision avoidance constraints through the non-holonomic motion model of the vehicle and analyzing the resulting behavior. We use a high fidelity simulator to benchmark our actuator dynamics augmented MPC with other related approaches in terms of metrics like inter-vehicle distance, trajectory smoothness, and velocity overshoot. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.\"],\n",

Along the path, the MAV explores the greatest unknown area although it sometimes misses minor unreconstructed region, such as a hole or a sparse surface. To cover such a region, we propose an online inspection algorithm that consistently provides an optimal coverage path toward the NBV in real time. The algorithm iteratively refines an inspection path according to the acquired information until the modeling of a specific local area is complete.

    "[826 \t,0,0,\"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtain a real-time solution for the minimum-time motion-planning problem for curvature-constrained AUVs in the presence of ocean currents. The existing solution to this problem is obtained by solving the six Dubins path types (i.e., LSL,\\ RSR,\\ LSR,\\ RSL,\\ LRL and RLR) in the presence of currents, four of which involve a root-finding problem consisting of transcendental functions. Thus, the computational complexity of the exiting solution makes it infeasible for real-time applications, such as rapidly changing oceanic environments. The proposed approach utilizes only the LSL and RSR path types from the Dubins set, which provide analytical solutions as needed for real-time applications. It is shown that by extending the feasible range of circular arcs in these path types from 2? to 4?, full reachability is guarantee; i.e., a solution can be obtained for every pair of start and goal poses. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed solution provides better time-costs with lower travel times as compared to the existing Dubins LSL and RSR paths.

The proposed method enables vehicles to adaptively generate a path by considering vehicle characteristics and the regulations, in a large-scale environment, with rough terrain. A random sampling based scheme was applied to carrying out global path planning, based on a 3-D environmental model.

The designed decision module effectively distinguishes between structured and unstructured roads and processes them separately, so that the algorithm is more robust in different environments. Besides, the movement of obstacles is considered in the decision-making and obstacle constraints generating module. By processing obstacles with lateral and longitudinal speed separately, obstacle avoidance can be done in scenarios with moving obstacles, including moving obstacles crossing the road. Instead of treating the vehicle as a mass point, we explicitly consider the geometric constraints by modeling the vehicle as three intersecting circles when generating obstacle constraints. This ensures that the vehicle is collision-free in motion planning, especially when the vehicle turns. For non-convex obstacle constraints, we propose an algorithm that generates up to two alternative linear constraints to convexify the obstacle constraints for improving computational efficiency. In MPC, we consider the vehicle kinodynamic constraints and two generated linear constraints. Therefore, the proposed method can achieve better real-time performance and can be applied to more complicated traffic scenarios with moving obstacles.

The problem is motivated to guarantee a safe mission plan in a case of loss of thrust for which it is desirable to have a safe gliding trajectory to a nearby airport. The problem combines computational challenges of the combinatorial multi-goal planning with demanding motion planning to determine safe landing trajectories for the curvature-constrained aerial vehicle. The crucial property of safe landing is a minimum safe altitude of the vehicle that can be found by trajectory planning to nearby airports using sampling-based motion planning such as RRT*. A trajectory is considered safe if the vehicle is at least at the minimum safe altitude at any point of the trajectory. Thus, a huge number of samples have to be evaluated to guarantee the safety of the trajectory, and an evaluation of all possible multi-goal trajectories is quickly computationally intractable. Therefore, we propose to utilize a roadmap of safe altitudes combined with the estimation of the trajectory lengths to evaluate only the most promising candidate trajectories.

    "[846 \t,0,0,\"In this research, an optimal real-time trajectory planning method is proposed for autonomous ground vehicles in case of overtaking a moving obstacle. When an autonomous vehicle detects a moving vehicle ahead of it in a proper speed and distance and the braking is not efficient due to the lost of its kinematic energy, the autonomous vehicle decides to overtake the obstacle by performing a double lane-change maneuver. A two-phase nonlinear optimal problem is developed for generating the path for the overtaking maneuver. The cost function of the first phase is defined in such a way that the vehicle approaches the moving obstacle as close as possible. Besides, the cost function of the second phase is defined as the minimization of the sum of the vehicle lateral deviation from the reference path and the rate of steering angle during the overtaking maneuver while the lateral acceleration of the vehicle does not exceed a safe limit. For the real-time path planning of a vehicle with high speed, the result of solving the optimal path planning are stored in the look-up table form for offline use. A full nonlinear vehicle modeled in CarSim software is used for path tracking simulation.

    "[847 \t,0,0,\"In this research, generation of a short and smooth path in three-dimensional space with obstacles for guiding an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) without collision is investigated. This is done by utilizing spline technique, in which the spline control points positions are determined by Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) in three-dimensional space such that the shortest possible path from the starting point to the target point without colliding with obstacles is achieved. Furthermore, for guiding the UUV in the generated path, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (IT2FLC), the coefficients of which are optimized by considering an objective function that includes quadratic terms of the input forces and state error of the system, is used. Selecting such objective function reduces the control error and also the force applied to the UUV, which consequently leads to reduction of energy consumption. Therefore, by using a special method, desired signals of UUV state are obtained from generated three-dimensional optimal path such that tracking these signals by the controller leads to the tracking of this path by UUV. In this paper, the dynamical model of the UUV, entitled as “mUUV-WJ-1”, is derived and its hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated by CFD in order to be used in the simulations. For simulation by the method presented in this study, three environments with different obstacles are intended in order to check the performance of the IT2FLC controller in generating optimal paths for guiding the UUV.

Existing lattice planners have two major limitations, namely the high dimensionality of the lattice and the lack of modeling of agent vehicle behaviors. We propose to apply the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [1] as a speed feedback policy to address both of these limitations. IDM both enables the responsive behavior of the agents, and uniquely determines the acceleration and speed profile of the ego vehicle on a given path.

    "[861 \t,1,1,\"In this work, we construct a minimum action method for dynamical systems with constant time delays. The minimum action method (MAM) plays an important role in seeking the most probable transition pathway induced by small noise. There exist two formulations of the minimum action method: One is the geometric formulation based on the Maupertuis principle, and the other one is the temporal formulation. The geometric formulation relies on the conservation of Hamiltonian corresponding to the Freidlin{Wentzell action functional. For systems with time delays, the Hamiltonian does not conserve due to the explicit dependence on the time delay, which implies that the geometric MAM is not applicable. We work with the temporal formulation of MAM for problems with time delays. By defining an auxiliary path, we remove the optimization with respect to time through the optimal linear time scaling. The pointwise correspondence between the auxiliary path and the delayed transition path is dealt with by a penalty term included into the action functional. The action functional is then discretized by the finite element method, and strategies for h-adaptive mesh refinement have been developed.

The algorithm enumerates different sequences of cars discharging from the intersection to minimize the objective function. Benefits of platooning (multiple cars consecutively discharging from a queue) and signal flexibility (adaptability to demand) are also considered. The goal is to gain insights about the value (in terms of delay savings) of using connected vehicle technology for intersection control.Simulations are conducted for different total demand values and demand ratios to understand the effects of changing the minimum green time at the signal and the penetration rate of connected cars. Using autonomous vehicle control systems, the signal could rapidly change the direction of priority without relying on the reaction of drivers. However, without this technology a minimum green time is necessary. The results of the simulations show that a minimum green time increases the delay only for the low and balanced demand scenarios. Therefore, the value of using cars with autonomous vehicle control can only be seen at intersections with this kind of demand patterns, and could result in up to 7% decrease in delay. On the other hand, using information from connected vehicles to better adapt the traffic signal has proven to be indeed very valuable. Increases in the penetration rate from 0% up to 60% can significantly reduce the average delay (in low demand scenarios a decrease in delay of up to 60% can be observed).

However, no proper framework is currently available to realistically model and estimate trajectories of turning vehicles reflecting the intersection geometries, which is critical for the reliability of simulation models. This study explores the applicability of the minimum-jerk principle, which has been initially applied in neuroscience and robotics domains, to model and simulate free-flow trajectories of turning vehicles. The modeling method is validated by comparing model outputs with empirical trajectories collected at several signalized intersections in Nagoya, Japan. The capability of the model in realistically capturing the variations in turning trajectories based on intersection geometry (e.g., intersection angle and turning radius) is also explained.

    "[873 \t,0,0,\"Integrated Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are the core of georeferencing Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) data. Divergence of attitude errors is a dominant issue when an INS has to work as a stand-alone system for extended periods. This issue can be mitigated by taking specific vehicle maneuvers to make attitude errors observable. Since MMS applications are time consuming and costly, it is preferable to design the trajectory and motion of the mapping vehicles in advance, to guarantee the accuracy of the attitude estimation and minimize the cost. This article investigates the estimation accuracy of attitude under different vehicle maneuvers theoretically through the observability analysis method. Both theoretical anal-ysis and tests show that the attitude estimation is significantly related with the type of vehicle maneuvers and motion parameters such as velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity. The motion with varying angular velocities is the most efficient motion to enhance the estimation of all attitude angles; the motion with varying accelerations can improve the yaw and pitch but has no effect on enhancing the roll. The uniform circular motion can improve the roll and pitch but has slight or no impact on enhancing the yaw (depending on the forward accelerometer error, the forward velocity, and the vertical angular velocity); the linear motion with a constant acceleration can improve the yaw (depending on the cross-track accelerometer error and the forward acceleration) and weakly improve the pitch but cannot improve the roll. The physical interpretations of these properties are also provided. The `S`-shaped motion with varying angular velocities is suggested for efficient attitude estimation; however, the circle, or `8`-shaped motion with uniform angular velocity, is not efficient for MMS applications. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.\"],\n",
    "[874 \t,0,0,\"Integrated motion planning and control for the purposes of maneuvering mobile robots under state- and input constraints is a problem of vital practical importance in applications of mobile robots such as autonomous transportation. Those constraints arise naturally in practice due to specifics of robot mechanical construction and the presence of obstacles in motion environment. In contrast to approaches focusing on feedback control design under the assumption of given reference motion or motion planning with neglection of subsequent feedback motion execution, we adopt a controller-driven motion planning paradigm, which has recently gained attention of many researchers. It postulates design of motion planning algorithms dedicated to specific feedback control policies, which compute a sequence of feedback control subtasks instead of classically planned open-loop controls or parametric paths. In this spirit, we propose a motion planning algorithm driven by the VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law for the waypoint-following task. Presented analysis of the VFO control law reveals its beneficial properties, which are subsequently utilized to solve a generally nonlinear and non-convex optimal motion planning problem by formulating it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The solution proposed in this paper yields a waypoint sequence, which is designed for execution by application of the VFO control law to drive a robot to a prescribed final configuration under an input constraint imposed by bounded curvature of robot motion and state constraints resulting from a convex decomposition of task space. Satisfaction of these constraints is guaranteed analytically and exactly, i.e., without utilization of numerical approximations. Moreover, for a given discrete set of possible waypoint orientations, the proposed algorithm computes plans optimal w.r.t. given cost functional, which can be any convex linear combination of quantities such as robot path length, curvature of robot motion, distance to imposed state constraints, etc. Furthermore, the planning algorithm exploits the possibility of both forward or backward movement of the robot to allow maneuvering in demanding environments. Generated waypoint sequences are a compact representation of a motion plan, which can be immediately executed with the VFO controller without any additional post-processing. Validity of the proposed approach has been confirmed by simulation studies and experimental motion execution with a laboratory-scale mobile robot. © 2017, The Author(s).\"],\n",

The intent prediction problem was formulated as a time-series prediction problem, whereas by just observing a short-window sequence of motion trajectory of pedestrians, a forecasting about their future lateral positions can be made up to 4 secs ahead. In the proposed approach, we utilized the widely adopted architecture of recurrent neural networks, Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) architecture to form a deep stacked LSTM network.

Particle swarm optimization is used to search for appropriate temporary waypoints, in which the optimization parameters of path planning are taken into account. Subsequently, an optimal path is automatically generated under the guidance of the destination and these temporary waypoints. Finally, three algorithms, including artificial potential field and genic algorithm, are adopted in the simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can generate the optimal paths compared with the other two algorithms. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\"],\n",

For the car equipped with ADAS, recently the new guidelines are establishing; SOTIF (Safety Of The Intended Functionality) standards. Mainly it focuses on the limitation of sensors and human misuse. Because an ADAS car has many sensors to know the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and so on. Also, the HMI has to bridge the gap between the human and machine-controlled area. We can extend SOTIF’s idea into the higher level of ADS (Automated Driving Vehicle), that is the autonomous car. There are many uncertainties when recognizing the environment. For example, an exact current location of the self-car, the other car’s information (speed/acceleration, azimuth), correct road condition, and so on.

During the process of local path planning, several path segmentation points were selected along the reference line that represented a path on the X-axis of the Frenet coordinate system. The control point was discretized along the Y-axis at each segmentation point in the Frenet coordinate system. A control point was subsequently selected for forming a set of path control points at each path split point. A cubic equation with one unknown attribute was applied for fitting each permutation-and-combination path, and the cost function was then employed for evaluating each permutation-and-combination path. The local path with minimum cost function value was selected as the optimal path. Furthermore, the cost function considered multiple aspects such as the limit of danger between the fit trajectory and obstacle, smoothness of the trajectory, degree of deviation of the trajectory from the reference line (an ideal trajectory obtained in real time according to the speed of a vehicle during global path planning), degree of variation in the driving direction of the fit trajectory, and minimum turning radius of the driverless car. Results obtained from simulation and experimentation with an actual vehicle indicate that under different experimental scenarios, the proposed local path-planning algorithm based on cost function can plan an optimal path that does not coincide with obstacles, can guarantee the smoothness of driving tracks for driverless cars, and can satisfy the real-time requirements of route planning. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

This task is usually explored based on the sensors’ pre-calibration (e.g. height or pitch angle), but can be challenging when the calibration fails (e.g. on the sloping and uneven roads). In this work, we propose a calibrated feature-point based (CFPB) method to estimate the car-following distance adaptive to rough roads, using a single camera. Instead of using the pre-calibrated parameters, CFPB method is based on the surrounding vehicles’ feature points. It benefits from the fixed coordinate relations among these points, which enables the algorithm to be adaptive to rough roads. These fixed coordinate relations can be calibrated during driving. Namely, after a few seconds of observation to a surrounding vehicle, the CFPB method can start working for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm takes the perspective-n-point method as the framework. YOLO V3 and scale-invariant feature transform are applied as the vehicle detector and feature point extractor. The feature point calibration is dynamically updated and the results are smoothened by a Kalman filter. The camera is chosen because of the good performance on objects detection and feature extraction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world road with dynamic traffic flow.

Due to the insufficient training data for all driving situiaitons, serious traffic accidents would happen if the intelligent driving system fails under the extreme conditions. By applying the viability theory to the dynamic adaptive analysis of the vehicle, the maximum safety space in high-dimension can be objectively calculated, which reflects the special advantages of this theory in the field of vehicle's safety. However, due to the high complexity of computation and long analyzing time, the iterative algorithm of this theory cannot meet the real-time control requirements of high-speed vehicles. The surface of the viability kernel is also too complex to be used directly by the intelligent driving system, for which the viability kernel eads to be transformed into the optimal path of the road.

    "[941 \t,1,1,\"Maneuver decision-making and trajectory planning play important roles in autonomous driving since a safe and flexible decision module is indispensable for navigation. Typical algorithms apply sampling methods to generate feasible trajectories. However, the fixed sampling distance and maneuver execution time in a sampling approach sacrifice the flexibility of algorithm. Moreover, since motion planning can be represented as a high-dimensional problem, it usually results in unnecessary samples that require additional resources to search the solution. Therefore, a semantic-level maneuver sampling and trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. In the upper-level maneuver decision, the decision-making problem is formulated as a selection of the forward leading object. A semantic-level decision tree is built to sample long-term maneuver sequences, and the safety corridor of each maneuver sequence is calculated according to the surrounding environment. In the lower-level trajectory planning, the process is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directions. First, a heuristic search method is proposed to generate longitudinal trajectory candidates for each maneuver sequence. Then, an exhaustive search algorithm is employed to synchronously generate the lateral trajectory within safety corridor. Among the generated trajectory candidates, the one with minimum cost will be chosen as the searching result. Furthermore, in order to improve the driving comfort, numerical optimization is adopted to refine the result by accounting for the constraints of kinematics and safety.

The anticipatory knowledge is used to improve prediction in filtering tasks. It is embedded in a Bayesian framework by introducing attractors, which modify the probabilistic propagation of state estimations. The attractors model how traffic participants typically behave, given environmental knowledge such as lane information, traffic lights, or indicator lights. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by modeling the fact that vehicles usually stay in their lane. We show that given correct context information and nonlinear traffic situations, the tracking error is considerably lower compared to conventional tracking methods.

Such approach can find its wide use in planning applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which not only have to avoid no-fly zones delimited by the airspace, but also zones of hazardous weather conditions such as turbulences and clouds, which move over time. First a spatiotemporal state space is defined to provide a formal representation of the time-varying search problem. The benefit of a spatiotemporal state space for the path planning of a vehicle moving in a time-varying vector field is also highlighted. Then a linear probabilistic movement model based on Gaussian distribution is proposed to estimate the probability of a state being occupied by obstacles. This probability is subsequently used to compute the travel cost in a discrete shortest path search. Finally, a fast subset path planning/replanning method is introduced. The planning method consists of performing the search on a selected subset of the state-space to reduce computation runtime. By adapting the subset of the state space, the efficiency of the search can be greatly increased and hence a fast global replanning is possible.

Shrinking these vehicles is desirable since agility increases. However, it entails smaller power sources and hence less flight time. Adding sensors on these systems also implies more energy consumption due to both the added weight and the supplied energy to the sensors. In this work, we build a framework to leverage the flow dynamic effects near surfaces to recognize grounds and ceilings during operations and to plan a trajectory while minimizing energy consumption. Our proposed framework leverages data from real experiments to model the behavior of the system near surfaces and graph theoretical approaches for energy efficient motion planning. As a result, this study indicates that i) we can detect surfaces during operations without the need of extra onboard sensors and ii) we can minimize energy consumption up to 15% when the system can fly near ground or ceiling surfaces.

In particular, the space between obstacles and the resultant constraints on vehicle motion may dominate the required planning model. This becomes important when considering the model of planning complex autonomous actions. Autonomous Surface vessels are increasing in capability to the point where they will be able to independently plan and execute complex tasks including many different spatially related subtasks. For an efficient selection of such tasks to be performed, the ability to explore and evaluate potential future states is required. To allow such exploration, the complex real-world environment must be reduced to a simplified model comprehensive enough to allow effective planning while still maintaining the simplicity required for effective search to be performed on future states.

Each vehicle robot starts from a fixed start point and moves toward a goal point along a fixed path, so as to avoid collisions and remain in communication connectivity with other robots.

Scenarios including up to four robots are simulated to demonstrate: 1) the effect of communication connectivity requirements on robot velocity profiles; and 2) the dependence of the solution computation time on the communication connectivity requirement. Typically the optimization improved connectivity at no appreciable cost in journey time (as measured by the arrival time of the last arriving robot).

    "[977 \t,1,1,\"Most human-centred robotic applications require robots to follow a certain pre-defined path. This makes the robot's autonomous movements acceptable and predictable for humans. Planning a trajectory for the robot thus involves guiding it along this desired path. The classical approach of segmenting a path into multiple waypoints and tracking them only works well in environments which are obstacle-free or contain fixed stationary obstacles. Movable or dynamic obstacles that can potentially lie directly on waypoints result in deadlock situations causing the robot to oscillate around the desired waypoint without moving forward. This chapter presents a novel approach for trajectory planning in which an Adaptive Virtual Target (AVT) is formulated that follows the desired path irrespective of surrounding obstacles. The AVT essentially plays the role of a moving reference for the trajectory planner to track. Additionally, the AVT velocity can be adapted such that the robot can catch up in case of deviations from the path due to obstacle avoidance manoeuvres.

The concerned optimal control problem, when parameterized into a large-scale nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, is extremely difficult to solve.

Although the feasible regions of NLP problems are clearly defined, the majority of NLP-solving processes still require high-quality initial guesses, which accelerate the convergence process. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal decomposition based initialization strategy to generate reliable initial guesses, so as to facilitate the NLP-solving process. In contrast to the typical facilitation strategies in robotic motion/path planning, our spatio-temporal decomposition strategy considers only objective kowledge, further breaking the limitation of subjective knowledge and making full use of a vehicle's maneuver potential.

In this paper, our goal is to evaluate a search heuristic function based on anisotropic vehicle velocity restrictions for building the cost matrix required for multi-vehicle routing on natural terrain and disaster sites. The heuristic is applied to compute the fastest travel times between every pair of matrix elements by means of a path planning algorithm. The analysis is based on a case study on the ortophotographic DEM of natural terrain with different target points, where the proposed heuristic is compared against an exhaustive search solution. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"],\n",
    "[1040\t,0,0,\"Navigation in a dynamic environment requires reactive actions to avoid collision and navigate safely. This paper deals with optimal and reactive motion planning for unmanned air vehicles in a dynamic world. A virtual space representation is used to formulate and solve the problem and derive real time optimal trajectories. This formulation allows for the construction of different control subspaces from which optimal control laws for the speed, the flight path angle, and the heading angle are derived. The safety margins are translated to the control subspaces as speed and orientation margins. Closed-form reactive optimal solutions are calculated to achieve reactive motion and avoid collision in each subspace. The dynamic and kinematic constraints are taken into account when planning motion in the control subspaces.

    "[1041\t,0,0,\"Navigation of micro air vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments is a complex sensing and trajectory generation task, particularly at high velocities. In this work, we introduce an efficient sense-and-avoid pipeline that compactly represents range measurements from multiple sensors, trajectory generation, and motion planning in a 2.5-dimensional projective data structure called an egospace representation. Egospace coordinates generalize depth image obstacle representations and are a particularly convenient choice for configuration flat mobile robots, which are differentially flat in their configuration variables and include a number of commonly used MAV plant models. After characterizing egospace obstacle avoidance for robots with trivial dynamics and establishing limits on applicability and performance, we generalize to motion planning over full configuration flat dynamics using motion primitives expressed directly in egospace coordinates. In comparison to approaches based on world coordinates, egospace uses the natural sensor geometry to combine the benefits of a multiresolution and multi-sensor representation architecture into a single simple and efficient layer. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).\"],\n",
    "[1042\t,0,0,\"Near-miss accidents at intersections are still reported globally. This is due to the driver inattention during the scenario. Though many collision warning systems have been introduced, such systems are ineffective in alerting the drivers during the sudden emergence of unknown moving vehicles at intersections. This paper proposes an intersection collision avoidance (CA) architecture, composed of Artificial Potential Field (APF) as the motion planning and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) as the path tracking strategy. To aid the driver inattention, APF considers the risk of intersections and collision with the moving obstacles. NMPC is adopted into the architecture to guide the CA navigation. When the host vehicle approaches the intersection, the desired deceleration value is yielded. Once the occluded moving obstacle appears, APF provides the desired vehicle states for path replanning based on the collision risks. NMPC acts as automated motion guidance for the host vehicle to handle the abrupt increment of vehicle summation forces during the navigation. To evaluate the system efficacy, computational simulation is done and the performance is compared with the Time-to-Collision and Safe-Distance to ensure its reliability in preventing near-miss accidents. Results show that the consideration of intersection risk together with the risk of collision with the moving obstacle aids in preventing near-miss intersection collisions. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London UK.\"],\n",

    "[1058\t,1,1,\"Objective: To understand which users’ characteristics influence their preferences in the selection of vehicle seating configurations and positions across different traveling scenarios involving a fully automated vehicle (FAV). Methods: Participants (n = 730) completed an online survey in which they were asked to imagine traveling in a FAV across three hypothetical scenarios. Participants were asked to select between five different seating configurations and four positions for each scenario and about their anthropometry and their driving/riding experience. Multinomial regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors that influenced users’ preferences. Results: FAV Configuration #3 (traditional light vehicle seating configuration) was the preferred seating configuration for 74% of the participants, followed by FAV #2 (in which the two seating rows face each other, 13%) in Scenario 1 (riding by oneself). Similar numbers were observed in Scenario 3 (riding with an unknown person). In Scenario 2 (riding with their partner), participants preferred FAV #2 (12.5%) and FAV #5 (in which the front seat passengers point toward a common point in the front, conventional rear seat configuration, 17.5%). Having close family was significant to choose the traditional vehicle configuration over other vehicle configurations, but only when the participants were driving by themselves. Having previously experienced motion sickness was significant to prefer a forward seating configuration when the trip was shared with partners. Belonging to a particular height or weight group was significantly associated with the preferred seat within the preferred FAV configuration (the driver’s position in FAV #3; a rear-facing seat in FAV #2), although there was not a clear trend between increasing weight and/or height and preferring one seating position over the others. Conclusions: Previous work had shown differences in participants’ preferences for seating configurations and positions depending on age, sex and country. While increasing the sample size, the current study analyses other factors that were associated with choosing one vehicle configuration and seating position over others. As these factors are directly related to the likelihood of sustaining injuries in the event of a crash, the current study provides important insights regarding the potential risk factors for FAV occupants. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"],\n",

A new generation of long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs), such as the Slocum glider and Tethys-class AUV, has emerged with high endurance, long-range, and energy-aware capabilities. These new vehicles provide an effective solution to study different oceanic phenomena across multiple spatial and temporal scales. For these vehicles, the ocean environment has forces and moments from changing water currents which are generally on the order of magnitude of the operational vehicle velocity. Therefore, it is not practical to generate a simple trajectory from an initial location to a goal location in an uncertain ocean, as the vehicle can deviate significantly from the prescribed trajectory due to disturbances resulted from water currents. Since state estimation remains challenging in underwater conditions, feedback planning must incorporate state uncertainty that can be framed into a stochastic energy-aware path planning problem. This article presents an energy-aware feedback planning method for an LRAUV utilizing its kinematic model in an underwater environment under motion and sensor uncertainties. Our method uses ocean dynamics from a predictive ocean model to understand the water flow pattern and introduces a goal-constrained belief space to make the feedback plan synthesis computationally tractable.

    "[1066\t,0,0,\"Ocean ecosystems have spatiotemporal variability and dynamic complexity that require a long-term deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle for data collection. A new long-range autonomous underwater vehicle called Tethys is adapted to study different oceanic phenomena. Additionally, an ocean environment has external forces and moments along with changing water currents which are generally not considered in a vehicle kinematic model. In this scenario, it is not enough to generate a simple trajectory from an initial location to a goal location in an uncertain ocean as the vehicle can deviate from its intended trajectory. As such, we propose to compute a feedback plan that adapts the vehicle trajectory in the presence of any modeled or unmodeled uncertainties. In this work, we present a feedback motion planning method for the Tethys vehicle by combining a predictive ocean model and its kinematic modeling. Given a goal location, the Tethys kinematic model, and the water flow pattern, our method computes a feedback plan for the vehicle in a dynamic ocean environment that reduces its energy consumption. The computed feedback plan provides the optimal action for the Tethys vehicle to take from any location of the environment to reach the goal location considering its orientation. Our results based on actual ocean model prediction data demonstrate the applicability of our method. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1073\t,1,1,\"On-board sensory systems in autonomous vehicles make it possible to acquire information about the vehicle itself and about its relevant surroundings. With this information the vehicle actuators are able to follow the corresponding control commands and behave accordingly. Localization is thus a critical feature in autonomous driving to define trajectories to follow and enable maneuvers. Localization approaches using sensor data are mainly based on Bayes filters. Whitebox models that are used to this end use kinematics and vehicle parameters, such as wheel radii, to interfere the vehicle's movement. As a consequence, faulty vehicle parameters lead to poor localization results. On the other hand, blackbox models use motion data to model vehicle behavior without relying on vehicle parameters. Due to their high non-linearity, blackbox approaches outperform whitebox models but faulty behaviour such as overfitting is hardly identifiable without intensive experiments. In this paper, we extend blackbox models using kinematics, by inferring vehicle parameters and then transforming blackbox models into whitebox models. The probabilistic perspective of vehicle movement is extended using random variables representing vehicle parameters. We validated our approach, acquiring and analyzing simulated noisy movement data from mobile robots and vehicles.

    "[1076\t,0,0,\"On-ramp merging scenario has a great impact on traffic efficiency and fuel economy. At present, most research on-ramp merging focuses on the optimization of merging sequence in the single main lane scenario, which fails to give full play to the capacity of multi-lane roads. To overcome this problem, an efficient on-ramp merging strategy (ORMS) is proposed to coordinate vehicle merging in multi-lane traffic. First, we built a model of the unevenness of traffic flow between lanes. Based on this model, we established a lane selection model by reinforcement learning for the coordination of vehicles in multi-lane traffic. Before vehicles enter the merging zone, the decision of lane selection is made by analyzing the unevenness of traffic flow between lanes to relieve local congestion in the outside lane that may be caused by ramp vehicle inflow. Then, we adopted a vehicle motion planning algorithm based on the time-energy optimal control, so that all vehicles travel according to the optimal trajectory to reach the merging zone. The simulation results show that the traffic efficiency and fuel economy of the proposed on-ramp merging strategy are significantly improved compared with the existing optimal control algorithm.

    "[1090\t,1,1,\"One of the most important and conventional manoeuvres, that is not easy to even skilled drivers, is the high-speed critical lane change on the highways. The main contribution of this study is the development of an integrated longitudinal and lateral guidance algorithm for these manoeuvres. This algorithm consists of two parts: the trajectory planning and the integrated control. In the first part, taking into account the position of the target vehicle for different accelerations, several trajectories are produced. Next, considering the dynamic capabilities of the vehicle, the most appropriate trajectory is selected. Since the proposed trajectory planning approach works algebraically, its computational cost is negligible, which is very valuable for practical implementations. In the second step, using a robust-integrated longitudinal–lateral controller, the control inputs are calculated and transmitted to the brakes, throttle and steering actuators. It should be noted that the trajectory planning and the integrated controller are based on the seven degrees of freedom model of the vehicle, and the nonlinear dynamics of the tyre and the dynamics of the brakes/throttle actuators are also taken into account. To assess the efficiency of the integrated longitudinal–lateral guidance algorithm, the full vehicle model is used in the CarSim–Simulink software. In order to have conditions closer to real applications, it is assumed that the yaw rate and the longitudinal and lateral accelerations of the vehicle are noisy, and the longitudinal and lateral velocities are predicted using the same signals. Obtained results for the critical collision avoidance manoeuvres confirm the effectiveness of the proposed planned trajectory and the good performance of the combined control method. In addition, the results indicate that the integrated control is robust against the variation of friction coefficient and unmodelled dynamics while maintaining the vehicle stability. © IMechE 2019.\"],\n",

This paper investigates the autonomous path planning for a pair of UAVs equipped with received signal strength (RSS) sensors applying optimum experimental design criteria based on the fisher information matrix (FIM). The control strategy steers the UAVs along the paths that minimize the emitter location uncertainty. Since there is one differential received signal strength (DRSS) measurement (two RSS sensors) in each time step, the emitter location uncertainty is infinite for a single measurement and the FIM is singular. The FIM is approximated at successive waypoints using the estimated location of the emitter produced by the extended kalman filter (EKF). The objective of this paper is to propose path planning approaches for minimum number of UAVs in DRSS-based localization based on different optimum criteria including D-, E-, A-optimality and sensitivity. Each criterion is related to a different characteristic of the estimation uncertainty ellipsoid and consequently generates different trajectories.

However, as a kind of common obstacles in complex three-dimensional (3-D) spaces, U-Type obstacles may cause UAV to be confused and even lead to a collision or out of control. Although most of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm can generate proper path, solutions to U-Type obstacles based on the specific behaviors of each ant are investigated rarely. Hence, different search strategies are studied and a novel ACO-based method called Self-Heuristic Ant (SHA) is proposed in this paper. The whole space is constructed by grid workspace model firstly, and then a new optimal function for UAV path planning is built. To avoid ACO deadlock state (i.e., ants are trapped in U-Type obstacles when there is no optional successor node), two different search strategies are designed for choosing the next path node. In addition, the SHA is utilized to improve the ability of the basic ACO-based method. Specifically, besides pheromone update, a new information communion mechanism is fused to deal with the special areas which contain dense obstacles or many concave blocks. Finally, several experiments are investigated deeply. The results show that the deadlock state can be reduced effectively by the designed two different search strategies of ants.

To be able to ensure dynamical feasibility of the planned trajectories, nonholonomic dynamics of wheeled vehicles must be considered. Nonlinear optimization based trajectory planners are proven to satisfy this need, however this happens at the expense of increasing computational effort, which jeopardizes the real-time applicability of these methods. This paper presents an algorithm which offers a solution to this problematic with a hybrid approach using artificial neural networks (ANNs). First, a nonlinear optimization based trajectory planner is presented which ensures the dynamical feasibility with the model-based prediction of the vehicle's motion. Next, an artificial neural network is trained to reproduce the behavior of the optimization based planning algorithm with the method of supervised learning. The generation of training data happens off-line, which eliminates the concerns about the computational requirements of the optimization-based method. The trained neural network then replaces the original motion planner in on-line planning tasks which significantly reduces computational effort and thus run-time. Furthermore, the output of the network is supervised by the model based motion prediction layer of the original optimization-based algorithm and can thus always be trusted. Finally, the performance of the hybrid method is benchmarked with computer simulations in terms of dynamical feasibility and run-time and the results are investigated. Examinations show that the computation time can be significantly reduced while maintaining the feasibility of resulting vehicle motions. © 2019 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.\"],\n",

In approaches that ignore the time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness, it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model. Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a low-dimensional state-space elsewhere.

    "[1142\t,0,0,\"Path planning is a relevant topic in robotics research because it allows an autonomous vehicle to find a collision-free route. Local path planning is important because it copes with the changing conditions in a dynamic environment. The Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) are a type of vehicles that have been studied in the last 25 years, and also in many applications requires a local path planning for collision avoidance. Before facing the obstacles of deploying in real vehicles or hardware it is important to test different techniques in a simulator. This work presents the development of a simulator for an autonomous surface vehicle after evaluating two possible frameworks that could act as a base platform, the Robotarium and the Matlab robotics toolbox with the robotics operating system.

    "[1143\t,1,1,\"Path planning is a vital function of robotic systems. Different from existing roadmap algorithms which first determine the free space and then determine the collision-free path, researchers recently proposed several convex relaxation based smoothing algorithms which first select an initial path to link the starting configuration and the goal configuration and then reshape this path to meet other requirements (e.g., collision-free conditions) by using convex relaxation. However, convex relaxation based smoothing algorithms often fail to give a satisfactory path, since the initial paths are selected improperly. Moreover, the curvature constraints were not considered in many existing convex relaxation based smoothing algorithms. In this paper, we show that we can first grid the whole configuration space to pick a candidate path and reshape the shortest path to meet our goal. This new algorithm inherits the merit of roadmap algorithms and a convex feasible set algorithm. We further discuss how to meet the curvature constraints by using both the Beamlet algorithm to select a better initial path and an iterative optimization algorithm to adjust the curvature of a path. Theoretical analysis and numerical testing results show that our algorithm can almost surely find a feasible path and require a short computation time. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

In this paper, we propose a general path planning strategy for free-floating space manipulators based on the representation space (RS) analytical method. RS consists of the representation variables which are connected to task attributes and base-coupled motion simultaneously, and it can be utilized to check task realizability and construct a path planning domain for free-floating space manipulators. To analyze the effects of base-coupled motion on path planning, we classify RS into five types according to different base control modes: fixed vehicle RS (FRS), attitude constrained RS (CRS), maximum reachable RS (MRS), guaranteed RS (GRS), and partly guaranteed RS (PGRS). CRS tells us the variation of base attitude (instead of base centroid position) directly influences task realizability and path planning, so we should particularly consider the control of motion of base attitude in path planning. With appropriately considering the control of base attitude and satisfying the base attitude deflection limitation, only PGRS can be utilized to check task realizability and construct a path planning domain for free-floating space manipulators. Then, we design a path planning strategy in PGRS based on A? algorithm.

    "[1176\t,0,0,\"Path planning plays an important role in various fields of application and research among robotics and autonomous vehicles. Correct path planning requires accurate vehicle positioning and tracking which are two highly crucial tasks for numerous applications in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Global Positioning System (GPS) is extremely affected by various error sources and accordingly produce inaccurate trajectory data. To make this data useful, it has to be linked to the road network with the aid of map matching. This paper introduces a method for processing Geo-data from OpenStreetMap as an environmental representation and also a method for solving the shortest route problem (route planning) using the bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithm. Moreover, the point to edge online map matching method is implemented using the data extracted from OpenStreetMap road network and Robot Operating System. These approaches are tested on a `Mitsubishi i-MiEV` fully electric vehicle in terms of performance and quality. The results discuss the quality of the path and local occupancy grid map that is generated. They also show that the matching technique presented is able to keep up with input frequencies up to 100Hz and produce high performing output compared to matching using linear search algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1177\t,0,0,\"Path planning plays an integral role in mission planning for ground vehicle operations in urban areas. Determining the optimum path through an urban area is a well-understood problem for traditional ground vehicles; however, in the case of autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), additional factors must be considered. For an autonomous UGV, perception algorithms rather than platform mobility will be the limiting factor in operational capabilities. For this study, perception was incorporated into the path planning process by associating sensor error costs with traveling through nodes within an urban road network. Three common perception sensors were used for this study: GPS, LIDAR, and IMU. Multiple set aggregation operators were used to blend the sensor error costs into a single cost, and the effects of choice of aggregation operator on the chosen path were observed. To provide a robust path planning ability, a fuzzy route planning algorithm was developed using membership functions and fuzzy rules to allow for qualitative route planning in the case of generalized UGV performance. The fuzzy membership functions were then applied to several paths through the urban area to determine what sensors were optimized in each path to provide a measure of the UGV's performance capabilities. The research presented in this paper shows the impacts that sensing/perception has on ground vehicle route planning by demonstrating a fuzzy route planning algorithm constructed by using a robust rule set that quantifies these impacts. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.\"],\n",

    "[1179\t,0,0,\"Path planning problem for a vehicle group in a two-dimensional obstructed environment is addressed. The kinematics equations of the vehicles on a plane with ideal connections are considered. Then a method is proposed for planning motion paths based on the interpretation of all the neighboring objects as repellers. The method on the basis of simple algorithms implemented in design of vehicles enables organization of the group motion without using a centralized algorithm. A new method for introduction of repellers which is based on formation of an unstable position in the vehicles phase space is proposed. Repulsive forces are generated as outputs of dynamic elements that integrate non-linear functions of the distance to the obstacles. As a result, we obtained the principles of changing speed and direction of the vehicles' motion. The stability analysis of the obtained paths was made using the method of Lyapunov functions. We showed steady state regime of a group of vehicles and its asymptotic stability. Modification of the planning algorithm with no setting of the trajectory is being proposed.

    "[1198\t,1,0,\"Planning is one of the key problems for autonomous vehicles operating in road scenarios. Present planning algorithms operate with the assumption that traffic is organised in predefined speed lanes, which makes it impossible to allow autonomous vehicles in countries with unorganised traffic. Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly. This work is hence a step forward towards achieving autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic, while similar effort would be required for planning problems such as intersections, mergers, diversions and other modules like localisation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Although most of the existing approaches provide proper path planning strategy, they cannot guarantee reduction of consumed energy by UGVs, which is provided via onboard battery with constraint power. Hence, in this paper, a new ant-based path planning approach that considers UGV energy consumption in its planning strategy is proposed. This method is called Green Ant (G-Ant) and integrates an ant-based algorithm with a power/energy consumption prediction model to reach its main goal, which is providing a collision-free shortest path with low power consumption. G-Ant is evaluated and validated via simulation tools. Its performance is compared with ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization approaches. Various scenarios were simulated to evaluate G-Ant performance in terms of UGV travel time, travel length, computational time by taking into account different numbers of iterations, different numbers of obstacle, and different population sizes. The obtained results show that the G-Ant outperforms the existing methods in terms of travel length and number of iteration. © 2013 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1201\t,0,0,\"Point stabilization control of wheeled inverted pendulum (WIP) vehicles remains a challenge because of the existing nonholonomic and underactuated characteristics. This paper proposes a point stabilization control method for the WIP vehicle based on motion planning, where a point-to-point motion is achieved by performing pivot steering and longitudinal motion successively to avoid the nonholonomic constraint. Specifically, to handle the underactuated problem, a kinematic coupling-based longitudinal trajectory planning approach is presented, by which both precise longitudinal movement and stability of vehicle body can be guaranteed. Moreover, a mathematical model of parameters optimization problem is deduced with strict analysis, and then the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain the appropriate trajectory parameters, which ensures the good performance of the trajectory planning method. On this basis, the point stabilization of the WIP vehicle can be effectively realized through a commonly used proportional-integral-derivative control approach.

    "[1202\t,0,0,\"Potential Field is one of the widely used path planning methods in robotics. This method assumes that a robotic system knows its current position and where the goal is. The location of obstacles is also known in advance for global path planning, or it can be detected from sensing in local path planning. Although the potential field method provides a convenient and simple way of generating paths, most previous approaches do not incorporate uncertainty of a platform position while it is moving. Unlike satellite-based navigation systems, a user positioning accuracy may significantly change in a local area if a positioning system basis on Ultra Wideband (UWB) or LTE/5G is used. Because the positioning accuracy varies while a vehicle navigates, an unmanned vehicle or a robot following a given path may experience dithering movement. In addition, this problem may lead to unnecessary oscillation and increase the probability of collision which is a critical treat for a safe navigation. To overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes the PF-DOP hybrid path planning algorithms, which is a variant of potential field that takes into account a user positioning accuracy. A user positioning accuracy (UPA) in an interested navigation area can be conveniently represented by Dilution of Precision (DOP) field. From the mixture of the potential and DOP fields, the proposed approach generates a hybrid directional flow that is able to guide an unmanned vehicle to the safer and more efficient paths. The hybrid directional flow is made by mixing the two fields with weighting factors which is also used in traditional potential field method as a coefficient. The weighting factors will vary depending on the user locations, but as the positioning accuracy can be derived from the user location, the user positioning accuracy is also associated. The paper will describe the systemic procedure in generating the PF-DOP hybrid path and how to avoid local minimum by using this algorithm. © 2018 Institute of Navigation.

Researchers have been studying the planning of velocity trajectories, a simpler form of motion planning, for over a decade now and many different methods are available. Dynamic programming has shown to be the most common choice due to its numerical background and ability to include nonlinear constraints and models. Although planning of an optimal trajectory is done in a systematic way, dynamic programming does not use any knowledge about the considered problem to guide the exploration and therefore explores all possible trajectories. A? is a search algorithm which enables using knowledge about the problem to guide the exploration to the most promising solutions first.

First, free state space (FSS) is established based on ago-vehicle state, road lane and traffic condition for permitting ago-vehicle move safely. In FSS, the vehicle's maneuver in preview distance can be inferred and the local target point can be designated. Next, sampling points is created in FSS. Combined with local target point, initial point and sampling points, road network can be generated consequently. Then, the approachable path in the road network are evaluated by constrains of the Euclidean distance and the vehicle dynamics constraints. In this way the unique shortest path satisfying the constraints are generated as an optimal path. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the algorithm are validated by simulation results.

In this paper, we consider the planning of G3-continuous planar paths with continuous and limited curvature in a motion environment that is bounded and contains obstacles modeled by a set of (non-convex) polygons. In practice, the curvature constraints often arise from mechanical limitations for the robot, such as limited steering and articulation angles in wheeled robots, or aerodynamic constraints in unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the planning problem under those stringent constraints, we improve upon known path primitives, such as Reeds-Shepp (RS) and CC-steer (curvature-continuous) paths. Given the initial and final robot configuration, we developed extend-procedure computing paths that can approximate RS paths with arbitrary precision, but guaranteeing G3-continuity. We show that satisfaction of all stated path constraints is guaranteed and, contrary to many other methods known from the literature, the method of checking for collisions between the planned path and obstacles is given by a closed-form analytic expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is not conservative, i.e., it allows for precise maneuvers in tight environments under the assumption of a rectangular robot footprint. The presented extend procedure can be integrated into various motion-planning algorithms available in the literature. In particular, we utilized the Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT*) algorithm in conjunction with our extend procedure to demonstrate its feasibility in motion environments of nontrivial complexity and low computational cost in comparison to a G3-continuous extend procedure based on ?3-splines. © 2018 by the author.\"],\n",

Based on formalized traffic rules and nondeterministic motion models, we perform reachability analysis to predict the set of possible occupancies and velocities of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Real-world experiments with a test vehicle in various traffic situations demonstrate the applicability and real-time capability of our over-approximative prediction for both online verification and fail-safe trajectory planning.

Path planning is the primary problem. The current path planning strategies become inefficient especially for traffic big data in cities of large population and urban area. To ensure real-time scheduling, we propose one efficient path planning strategy with balanced QoS (e.g., waiting time, detour) by restricting search area for each PV, so that a large number of computation is saved.

Design/methodology/approach: An algorithm is presented that respects the dynamic constraints of the robot, including the characteristics of power delivery by the motor, the behaviour of the tires and the basic inertial parameters. Using quadratic sequential programming with distributed and non-monotonous search direction (Quadratic Programming Algorithm with Distributed and Non-Monotone Line Search), an optimization algorithm proposed and developed by Professor K. Schittkowski is implemented. Findings: Relations between important operating variables have been obtained, such as the evolution of the autonomous vehicle’s velocity, the driving torque supplied by the engine and the forces acting on the tires. In a subsequent analysis, the aim is to analyse the relationship between trajectory made and energy consumed and calculate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Also this method has been checked against another different methodology commented on in the references. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation comes from the modelling that has been done. As greater is the mechanical systems analysed, more simplifying hypotheses should be introduced to solve the corresponding equations with the current computers. However, the solutions are obtained and they can be used qualitatively to draw conclusions. Practical implications: One main objective is to obtain guidelines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy consumption in the realization of autonomous vehicles’ trajectories. The first step to achieve that is to obtain a good model of the autonomous vehicle that takes into account not only its kinematics but also its dynamic properties, and to propose an optimization process that allows to minimize the energy consumed. In this paper, important relationships between work variables have been obtained. Social implications: The idea is to be friendly with nature and the environment. This algorithm can help by reducing an instance of greenhouse gases. Originality/value: Originality comes from the fact that we not only look for the autonomous vehicle’s modelling, the simulation of its motion and the analysis of its working parameters, but also try to obtain from its working those guidelines that are useful to reduce the energy consumed and the contamination capability of these autonomous vehicles or car-like robots. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"],\n",

We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory.

To enable smart technology, such as health monitoring and electromagnetic braking for railway vehicles, a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) based energy harvesting shock absorber (EHSA) has been proposed and proved to be capable of scavenging energy from the train suspension vibration. When installed on the train, MMR-EHSA works as a tunable damper in parallel with an inerter. This new suspension form brings great potential for further optimization of suspension dynamics but is rarely researched before. In this paper, the influence of the energy harvesting shock absorber (EHSA) on the railway vehicle dynamics performance is studied. A ten-degree of freedom vehicle model is established, with MMR shock absorber’s nonlinearity taken into account, with the purpose to analyze the influence of the EHSA on the ride comfort and wheel-rail vertical forces. Simulations are conducted by replacing the traditional shock absorber from train secondary suspension with the EHSA. Results show that EHSA could respectively harvest 180 W and 40 W average power at AAR 6th and 5th rail irregularity.

    "[1227\t,0,0,\"Range-based target localization is an important class of problems that arise in an increasing number of scientific and commercial missions at sea. Underwater target localization refers to the task of estimating the positions of fixed or moving underwater targets by using range measurements between the targets and one or more autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), called trackers, undergoing trajectories that are known in real time. In this context, the trackers must execute sufficiently exciting maneuvers so as to maximize the range-based information available for multiple target localization. In this paper, adopting an estimation theoretical setting, we first propose a general methodology for tracker motion planning that results from maximizing the determinant of an appropriately defined Fisher information matrix (FIM) subject to inter-vehicle collision avoidance and vehicle maneuvering constraints. Then, for the single-target single-tracker problem (which is the dual problem of the classical single-beacon navigation problem), we provide a family of analytical solutions for the optimal tracker trajectories and complement the results with a practical experiment using a tracker when the target undergoes trajectories that are straight lines, pieces of arcs, or a combination thereof. In the methodology adopted for system implementation the tracker runs three key algorithms simultaneously, over a sliding time window: (i) tracker motion planning, (ii) tracker motion control, and (iii) target motion estimation based on range data acquired on-line. In order to simplify the types of trajectories that the tracker must undergo in the single target localization problem, we extend the above set-up to the case where the tracker works in cooperation with another vehicle, called companion, that can also measure ranges to the target and share this info with the tracker. The latter may have access to the position of the companion or, in some cases, only to the range between the two vehicles. We consider three different operating scenarios where the motion of the tracker is chosen so as to increase the accuracy with which the position of the target can be estimated. The scenarios reflect the situations where the motion of the companion vehicle satisfies one of three conditions: (i) the motion is not defined a priori and can also be optimized, (ii) the motion is fixed a priori and is known to the tracker (scenario in which the tracker benefits from the extra information acquired by the companion vehicle, which tracks a desired trajectory in the context of a separate, independent mission), and (iii) the motion is not known a priori and must be learned in the course of the mission.

Global positioning systems (GPSs) are used to estimate the absolute position of a vehicle from satellite signals, but their reliability and accuracy are not sufficient for precise control. An inertial navigation system (INS) is often used to complement the GPS, but it is always subjected to a drift problem due to integration. Such a problem has been solved by utilizing a high performance GPS, an INS, a vision sensor, a radar, a laser scanner, or their combination. However, these sensor systems are very expensive compared to the price of common commercial vehicles, which hinders the popularization of self-driving vehicles. Moreover, the target users of self-driving vehicles are most likely the elderly, as well as the blind, and thus the price is an important factor in the system design. In this paper, a sensor fusion method for a low-price self-driving vehicle and real-time path planning algorithm without a laser scanner are introduced. The proposed low-price sensor system consists of a GPS, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with a three-axes accelerometer, a three-axes gyroscope, and a three-axes magnetometer, an encoder at the real wheels, and a potentiometer that measures the steering angle. The overall price is less than 300 USD. For the complete estimation of the absolute position and orientation of the vehicle, the proposed method estimates the driving velocity using a kinematic Kalman filter, then the orientation angle and absolute position are calculated by the recursive least squares method.

Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics.

However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users.

Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone.

As a representative driving pattern of autonomous vehicles, the platooning technology has great potential for reducing transport costs by lowering fuel consumption and increasing traffic efficiency. In this paper, to improve the driving efficiency of autonomous vehicular platoon in terms of fuel consumption, a path planning scheme is envisioned using deep reinforcement learning on the network edge node.

In parallel, several applications are being envisioned that bring together a swarm of multiple networked micro air vehicles to accomplish large tasks in coordination. However, it is still very challenging to deploy multiple micro air vehicles concurrently. To address this challenge, we have developed an open software/hardware platform called the University at Buffalo’s Airborne Networking and Communications Testbed (UB-ANC), and an associated emulation framework called the UB-ANC Emulator. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, which combines multi-micro air vehicle planning and control with high-fidelity network simulation, enables practitioners to design micro air vehicle swarm applications in software and provides seamless transition to deployment on actual hardware. We demonstrate the UB-ANC Emulator’s accuracy against experimental data collected in two mission scenarios: a simple mission with three networked micro air vehicles and a sophisticated coverage path planning mission with a single micro air vehicle. To accurately reflect the performance of a micro air vehicle swarm where communication links are subject to interference and packet losses, and protocols at the data link, network, and transport layers affect network throughput, latency, and reliability, we integrate the open-source discrete-event network simulator ns-3 into the UB-ANC Emulator.

Comprehensive analysis of an AUV in the simulated environment using a set of nonlinear differential equations will be define with six degree of freedom dynamical motion. The mathematical model of autonomous underwater vehicle strongly depends upon the dynamic response, accurate control, navigation, and guidance path for the AUV. Accurate modeling of underwater vehicle is therefore of prime importance for precision control and for the execution of path planning missions. An AUV is subjected to follow a nonlinear target point path. Tracking this desired nonlinear path makes the modeling and control of the AUV more challenging task. In this study, the control techniques to the horizontal motion of an AUV equipped with an adaptive path tracking control system and Model Predictive Controller (MPC) control law will be applied to carried out detailed understanding of a complex AUV model under critical Transitional Maneuvers (TMs)and establish a smooth tracking of the desired target point.

    "[1272\t,0,0,\"Research on dynamic path planning for autonomous vehicle has been increased significantly in recent years because of the percentage of car accidents reduced by autonomous driving. The functions of Artificial Potential Fields (APF) as mentioned in previous studies, particularly nonlinear constraint, speed and safe distance, are seldom discussed or mentioned. In this paper, we focus on the need for vehicle safety. Thus, this study proposes a fuzzy artificial potential field path planning algorithm (FZ-APF) for local path planning in vehicle. FZ-APF introduces the distance factor to solve the well-known drawbacks of the traditional APF like goal non-reachable with obstacle nearby (GNRON) problem. However, FZ-APF not only optimizes path but also deals with the constraints of vehicle like the limit of steering angle at different speeds. Therefore, FZ-APF introduces longitudinal potential function to make the planned path accord with vehicle characteristics. In addition, to achieve more safe and efficient FZ-APF for vehicle, the fuzzy technique which adjusts the parameters at any moment according to the current speed and safety distance of the vehicle is added into FZ-APF. Numerical simulations are presented and validate the proposed algorithm under some complicated test scenarios. Experiment eventually illustrates the efficiency of this FZ-APF algorithm using an autonomous vehicle prototype. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\"],\n",

This gives rise to a challenging problem as it requires not only planning collision-free and dynamically feasible motions but also reasoning temporally about when and where the robot should be. While significant progress has been made in integrating task and motion planning, there are still no effective approaches for multigoal motion planning when both dynamics and time windows must be satisfied. To effectively solve this challenging problem, this paper develops an approach that couples temporal planning over a discrete abstraction with sampling-based motion planning over the continuous state space of feasible motions. The discrete abstraction is obtained by imposing a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. At each iteration of a core loop, the approach first invokes the temporal planner to find a solution over the roadmap abstraction. In a second step, the approach uses sampling to expand a motion tree along the regions associated with the discrete solution. Experiments are conducted with second-order ground and aerial vehicle models operating in complex environments.

This multi-objective problem considers the environmental disturbances and the possibilities for vehicles deployment during a mission. Although the recent advancements in embedded processors and sensor technology have opened new opportunities in underwater motion planning and facilitated AUVs to handle long-range operations, the inaccuracy of existing knowledge on uncertain spatiotemporal environment extends the complexity of motion planning problem. The class of underwater vehicles still have major challenges in dealing with uncertain ocean current variability that can strongly affect their motion, battery usage and mission duration. Current variations can also drift moving objects across the vehicle’s trajectory; therefore, the planned path may turn to be invalid or inefficient. Another challenge is that having a precise estimation of the behaviour of such an uncertain/dynamic environment in long-range operations, outside the vehicle’s sensor coverage, is usually unreliable and impractical. The robustness of a vehicle’s path planning to this strong environment variability is a crucial consideration in vehicle’s safety and mission performance. No polynomial time algorithm exists to solve an NP-hard problem of even moderate size. On the other hand, obtaining an absolute optimum solution is only applicable in fully known and certain environments.

The AEC architecture has two levels: an upper level to perform motion planning, based on the optimal control of a nonlinear particle model, and a lower level to distribute the resulting two-dimensional acceleration reference to the available actuators. The lower level adopts the recently introduced Modified Hamiltonian Algorithm (MHA), which continuously adjusts the priority between mass-centre acceleration and yaw moment demands derived from lateral stability targets. AEC makes use of a high precision map and triggers control interventions based on vehicle kinematic states and detailed road geometry. To avoid false-positive interventions, AEC is triggered only when excessive road departure is predicted for the optimal particle motion.

After that, the motion planning of autonomously controlled vehicle is formulated as a multi-objectives and multi-constraints optimization problem with model predictive control.

    "[1299\t,0,0,\"Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) is a major trajectory planning approach in autonomous driving given its high efficiency in practice. As the core of SBMP schemes, sampling strategy holds the key to whether a smooth and collision-free trajectory can be found in real-time. Although some bias sampling strategies have been explored in the literature to accelerate SBMP, the trajectory generated under existing bias sampling strategies may lead to sharp lane changing. To address this issue, we propose a new learning framework for SBMP. Specifically, we develop a novel automatic labeling scheme and a 2-Stage prediction model to improve the accuracy in predicting the intention of surrounding vehicles. We then develop an imitation learning scheme to generate sample points based on the experience of human drivers. Using the prediction results, we design a new bias sampling strategy to accelerate the SBMP algorithm by strategically selecting necessary sample points that can generate a smooth and collision-free trajectory and avoid sharp lane changing. Data-driven experiments show that the proposed sampling strategy outperforms existing sampling strategies, in terms of the computing time, traveling time, and smoothness of the trajectory. The results also show that our scheme is even better than human drivers. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\"],\n",

Due to the large variety of driving situations within the context of automated driving, it is very challenging to manually design such distributions. This letter introduces, therefore, a data-driven approach utilizing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN): Given the current driving situation, future ego-vehicle poses can be directly generated from the output of the CNN allowing to guide the motion planner efficiently toward the optimal solution. A benchmark highlights that the CNN predicts future vehicle poses with a higher accuracy compared to uniform sampling and a state-of-the-art A?-based approach.

The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application.

However, urban highway bridges and viaducts are loaded constantly by heavy traffic, therefore it is important to elucidate the effects of moving vehicles on the seismic response of bridges. This paper proposed a seismic response analysis framework incorporating vehicle–bridge interactions (VBI) with nonlinear dynamic analysis. The proposed method integrates a commercial FEA package, ABAQUS, into the authors’ in-house VBI-solving programs developed using MATLAB. With the proposed method, the effects of vehicle dynamics on seismic responses of a highway bridge could be clarified and the seismic performance of the bridge could be checked. For the bridge and ground motions studied herein, it was observed that continuously moving vehicles might yield larger longitudinal displacement responses at pier tops and plastic deformations at pier bottoms than those of the bridge alone, implying that ignoring vehicles’ additional mass effect and dynamic effects during earthquakes might be on the non-conservative side. Acceleration responses of pier tops and relative displacements of bearings were generally reduced by the moving vehicles. Besides the reason that the vehicles act like dampers on the bridge, it was most probably that the vehicle-bridge in-phase modes were excited by specific ground motions to a level lower than the original bridge-alone mode was, which could be indicated from their corresponding pseudo acceleration response spectra. Although the out-of-phase modes were excited to a similar level to the original bridge-alone mode was, these modes might dissipate some seismic energy that would have been dissipated by the bridge components and reduced displacement of the bearing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

Currently, environmental scientists collect SR data either by manually taking measurements in the field, which is time intensive, or by receiving information from permanently placed sensors, which limits the locations where data is collected. This project aims to provide an efficient means of collecting spatially diverse data for environmental research and agricultural monitoring by designing and constructing an autonomous ground vehicle that can navigate to specific points of interest, collect SR and other ambient atmospheric measurements, and transmit the data remotely to a base station. To do so, the robot relies on a variety of subsystems including the robot's frame, differential steering, a mechanical arm that deploys an array of ground sensors, a radio network, and on-board temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and GPS ambient atmospheric sensors. The vehicle will use the Robot Operating System (ROS) along with GPS, motion planning, and LIDAR to navigate between user-specified sampling locations while avoiding obstacles, which will minimize the need for human labor and allow more areas to be visited for data collection as compared to permanently placed sensors.

Motion planning for multiple agents is an NP (non-deterministic polynomial-time) hard problem, so the computation time increases exponentially with each addition of agents.

    "[1331\t,0,0,\"Stereo cameras are widely used in autonomous vehicles as environmental perception sensors because of their availability and low cost. However, efficiently utilizing the obtained disparity images to generate a desirable local path for the vehicle still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel navigation framework for autonomous vehicles equipped with stereo cameras, featuring finishing all of the perception and path planning tasks directly within the disparity space. Comparing with the popular 3-D counterpart, disparity is a projected geometric space that contains more primitive information directly computed from the stereo images. Furthermore, disparity image is a more compact representation for large field of 3-D Cartesian space, which makes perception and path finding in longer distance possible. The proposed framework is composed of three modules, namely, local disparity map building, slope analysis and obstacle detection, and path planning. Two important properties concerning the motion and slope in disparity space are presented for the first time, i.e., the motion model and the slope model in disparity space. With the motion model, the framework first fuses consecutive disparity maps to construct a more reliable and complete local map. Then, a novel slope analysis method called V-Intercept is developed based on the slope model. It can efficiently analyze slopes and obstacles, generating a reasonable cost map directly from the disparity image. Finally, the obstacles in the cost map are expanded properly, and a customized A? search algorithm is performed to find a reasonable path in disparity space. The experimental results show that our framework works well under various kinds of environments. The resulting system can efficiently perceive and plan on a much larger range and react to obstacles further beyond the traditional Cartesian-based method. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1332\t,1,1,\"Stochastic Model Predictive Control has proved to be an efficient method to plan trajectories in uncertain environments, e.g., for autonomous vehicles. Chance constraints ensure that the probability of collision is bounded by a predefined risk parameter. However, considering chance constraints in an optimization problem can be challenging and computationally demanding. In this paper, we present a grid-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control approach. This approach allows to determine a simple deterministic reformulation of the chance constraints and reduces the computational effort, while considering the stochastic nature of the environment. Within the proposed method, we first divide the environment into a grid and, for each predicted step, assign each cell a probability value, which represents the probability that this cell will be occupied by surrounding vehicles. Then, the probabilistic grid is transformed into a binary grid of admissible and inadmissible cells by applying a threshold, representing a risk parameter. Only cells with an occupancy probability lower than the threshold are admissible for the controlled vehicle. Given the admissible cells, a convex hull is generated, which can then be used for trajectory planning. Simulations of an autonomous driving highway scenario show the benefits of the proposed grid-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control method. © 2020 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1334\t,0,0,\"Summary In unmanned aerial vehicles navigation, path planning is aimed at obtaining the optimal safety path between start and destination locations. The efficiency and optimality criterion depend on the environment and planning method adopted. In this paper, a general fast path planning framework is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicles navigation. Standard A? search is performed online on the roadmap, which consists of path segments that are pre-computed offline with the aid of a multi-resolution grid and terminate at somewhere along the boundary between adjacent cells. Fast marching method (FMM) was employed for two aspects of the roadmap pre-computation: The location of segment termination points is determined by FMM propagation from the center of a given cell at the highest resolution grid, and the actual segments are computed using FMM between all pairs of nodes belonging to a given cell at all resolutions. Environment dynamics are taken into account by replanning from scratch after modifying the costs associated with the path segments that intersect 'threat' or 'no-fly' zones. The altitude along the planned path is determined in a post-processing step by inspecting the elevation profile along the path and using Sparse A searching method. The experimental results show that planning speed can be improved significantly with the proposed method, especially, fast online path planning can be achieved to adapt to environmental changes.

Results demonstrated that the motion of supercavitating vehicle has nonlinear dynamic characteristics. As cavitation number varies, some physical phenomena such as Hopf bifurcation, periodic bifurcation, and chaos occured. Moreover, vibration and shock can be effectively suppressed by adjusting fin's control law, then a stable movement of the supercavitating vehicle can be achieved. © 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.\"],\n",

    "[1337\t,1,0,\"Systems that enable high levels of vehicle-automation are now beginning to enter the commercial marketplace. Road vehicles capable of operating independently of real-time human control under an increasing set of circumstances will likely become more widely available in the near future. Such vehicles are expected to bring a variety of benefits. Two such anticipated advantages (relative to human-driver vehicle control) are said to be increased road network capacity and the freeing up of the driver-occupant's time to engage in their choice of leisurely or economically-productive (non-driving) tasks.In this study we investigate the implications for intersection capacity and level-of-service of providing occupants of automated (without real-time human control), autonomously-operating (without vehicle-to-X communication) cars with ride quality that is equivalent (in terms of maximum rates of longitudinal and lateral acceleration) to two types of rail systems: [urban] light rail transit and [inter-urban] high-speed rail. The literature suggests that car passengers start experiencing discomfort at lower rates of acceleration than car drivers; it is therefore plausible that occupants of an autonomously-operating vehicle may wish to instruct their vehicle to maneuver in a way that provides them greater ride comfort than if the vehicle-control algorithm simply mimicked human-driving-operation.On the basis of traffic microsimulation analysis, we found that restricting the dynamics of autonomous cars to the acceleration/deceleration characteristics of both rail systems leads to reductions in a signalized intersection's vehicle-processing capacity and increases in delay. The impacts were found to be larger when constraining the autonomous cars' dynamics to the more-restrictive acceleration/deceleration profile of high-speed rail. The scenarios we analyzed must be viewed as boundary conditions, because autonomous cars' dynamics were by definition never allowed to exceed the acceleration/deceleration constraints of the rail systems. Appropriate evidence regarding motorists' preferences does not exist at present; establishing these preferences is an important item for the future research agenda.This paper concludes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

    "[1340\t,0,0,\"Taking the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission planning as the research background, we adopt the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) to establish an effective UAV path planning scheme under obstacle-avoidance constraint in this paper. UAV path planning is the basis and premise of UAV mission execution. The essence of UAV path planning is to obtain the feasible flight path planning from the starting point to the target point according to the specific task of UAV. Simultaneously, effective UAV path planning should reach the optimal performance while meeting the demand of different constraints. ACO is a swarm intelligence algorithm that ants cooperate with pheromone. That is, ACO has great scalability and robustness, which is compatible to UAV path planning problem. In this paper, taking the obstacle-avoidance constraint into consideration, we build an effective UAV path planning strategy based on ACO to acquire the shortest UAV route. Experiments and analyses demonstrate that, when the obstacle number gradually increased from one to three, the proposed algorithm can all achieve the optimal UAV path planning. Hence, the rationality and applicability of the proposed algorithm are verified. Besides, the proposed algorithm can still realize the optimal UAV path planning when further adding the obstacle number and increasing the complexity of multiple obstacles. Thus, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are ulteriorly proved. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm has certain practical significance. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

We construct the static threat (ST) model based on an intuitionistic fuzzy set (A-IFS) to deal with the uncertainty of a environmental threat. The problem of avoiding a dynamic threat (DT) is formulated as a pursuit-evasion game. A reachability set (RS) estimator of an uncertain DT is constructed by combining the motion prediction with a RRT-based method. An online path planning framework is proposed by integrating a sub goal selector, a sub tasks allocator and a local path planner. The selector and allocator are presented to accelerate the path searching process. Dynamic domain rapidly-exploring random tree (DDRRT) is combined with the linear quadratic Gaussian motion planning (LQG-MP) method when searching local paths under threats and uncertainties. The path that has been searched is further improved by using a safety adjustment method and the RRT* method in the planning system.

However, many studies concentrate on minimizing total distance of AUVs serving targets at different locations, and mostly do not pay attention to workload balance among inhomogeneous AUVs. What is more, most of them do not think of the effect of ocean current while distributing tasks. To solve these problems, a novel dual competition strategy based on self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is put forward.

In order to fulfill a balanced task assignment among AUVs, a task balance coefficient is also proposed. Meanwhile, a hybrid path planning approach is applied to guide AUVs to reach their targets safely. The good performance of the proposed algorithm for distributing tasks among AUVs is demonstrated through simulation studies.

The rank-based ant system works well in static environments, but cannot adapt well to dynamic environments. Considering the difficulty in accurate digitization of dynamic factors, the improved ACO was integrated with the FL into the fuzzy logic ant colony optimization (FLACO) to find the optimal path for unmanned vehicles. Finally, the FLACO, the classic ACO and the improved ACO were separately applied to find the optimal path in a road network, with a novel concept called virtual path length. The results show that the FLACO output the shortest virtual path among the three algorithms, i.e. identified the most cost-effective path.

This paper introduces the steps of motion planning for a driverless carrier vehicle from the positions initially available to the speed of the wheels. The vehicle is located in the High-Tech Logistics Systems Laboratory of the Logistics Institute of the University of Miskolc. For motion controlling and simulation between two points the further modules are necessary: 1. path planner, 2. trajectory planner, 3. velocity-voltage converter using velocities gained from trajectory planner, 4. motion controlling and simulation of a motor dynamical model using voltages from the converter, 5. simulation of the path and 6. data processing. In this paper the first two modules are detailed, i.e. the path planning and then the trajectory planning. Path planning is based on a new approach, using Bezier-curves and Hermite curves. The trajectory planning tends to the mininum energy, which can be carried out by the examining the current consumption created in the other modules. The smaller consumption originated from the two curves determines the final path and trajectory. © 2021 Manufacturing Technology. All rights reserved.\"],\n",

    "[1356\t,0,0,\"The Chaplygin beanie is a single-input robotic vehicle for which partial planar motion control can be achieved by exploiting a simple nonholonomic constraint. A previous paper suggested a strategy for such motion control. In the present paper, this strategy is validated experimentally and extended to the context of multi-vehicle coordination. It is then shown that when the plane on which two such vehicles operate is translationally compliant, energy transfer between the two can enable a mechanism whereby one (operating under control) may entrain the other (operating passively), partly coordinating their motion. As an extension to this result, it is further demonstrated that a pair of passive vehicles operating on a translationally compliant platform can eventually attain the same heading when released from their deformed configurations.

Throughout this project, the team was challenged to create innovative concepts during the ideation phase as part of building the running vehicle. This paper describes the usability studies performed on two of the vehicle concepts that require driver interaction. One concept is a human machine interface (HMI) that uses a holographic companion that can act as a concierge for all functions of the vehicle. After creating a prototype using existing technologies and developing a user interface controlled by hand gestures, a usability study was completed with older adults. The results suggest the input method was not intuitive. Participants demonstrated better performance with tasks using discrete hand motions in comparison to those that required continuous motions. The data were helpful to understand the challenges of untrained users interacting with a new HMI system. The second concept is a parking assist system designed to help other drivers. A usability study evaluated the intuitiveness of the parking assist concept using a driving simulator. The results showed that all of the participants understood the purpose of the system without any explanation. The majority of the participants reported they would like to have this type of parking assist system on their own vehicle and would benefit from it while parking. Future efforts should integrate the HMI's companion with the parking assist system to increase distinctiveness and personalization. The goal of the companion is to not only act as a concierge, but to give additional information to external traffic as well.

The majority of EU effort towards reducing emissions is aimed at vehicle manufacturers, mandating development of more efficient engines in order to reduce emissions. We propose a complementary approach to help reach the EU goals. Due to the need for motorists to repeatedly stop and accelerate while driving in urban areas, overall emission rates are observed to be higher in these environments than on open motorways. As a result, management algorithms that focus on harmonising the flow of traffic in urban centres have the potential to greatly reduce urban emission rates. In this paper, we propose a set of functionalities in form of ”use cases” in order to illustrate the inefficiencies of urban traffic flow by utilising cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. The major contribution of this paper is in addressing the potential positive impact of such measures. The results and the expected effects of the algorithms were determined using a microscopic traffic simulation model. Importantly, this approach also addresses the transition phase, when only a limited number of cooperative and automated vehicles1 (CAVs) will be introduced into traffic, resulting in a mix of automated and non-automated vehicles on the roadways. We demonstrate that introducing CAVs into traffic can lead to significant progress towards EU emissions targets, even for lower penetration levels. According to our models, full use of CAVs on roadways would lead to a CO2 emissions decrease of 10–19%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

However, if traffic boats do not comply with the demands of the convention, thereby increasing the danger level, then adhering to the COLREGS may be dangerous for the unmanned surface vehicle.

This algorithm is used to solve the possible failure of collision avoidance when the unmanned surface vehicle invariably obeys the COLREGS during the avoidance process. An obstacle avoidance model based on the velocity obstacle method was established. Thereafter, an eccentric expansion operation on traffic boats was proposed to ensure a reasonable balance between safety and the rules of COLREGS. The expansion parameters were set according to the rules of COLREGS and the risk level of collision. Then, the collision avoidance parameters were calculated based on the aforementioned motion model. With the use of MATLAB and Unity software, a semi-physical simulation platform was established to perform the avoidance simulation experiment under different situations.

Algorithms are presented for the restricted case, where each orbit inspects a single target (only), and the general case, where orbits inspect multiple targets.

This challenge gets more difficult when the autonomous vehicle has to drive through complex scenarios such as intersections which demand interactive behaviour between vehicles. Many autonomous vehicle demonstrations over the last few decades have highlighted the limitations in the current state-of-the-art of path planning solutions. They have been found to be inefficient and sometimes unsafe when tackling interactively demanding scenarios. The generic path planning solutions consists of three planners, a 'global path planner', a 'behaviour planner' and a 'local path planner.

In this paper, we present a novel planning-based approach for long-term human motion prediction that accounts for local interactions and can accurately predict joint motion of multiple agents. Long-term predictions are handled using an MDP formulation that computes a set of stochastic motion policies. To obtain distributions over future motion trajectories, we sample the policies with a weighted random walk algorithm in which each person is locally influenced by social forces from other nearby agents.

One of the key aspects for automated driving is the planning of safe, dynamically feasible, comfortable and customizable trajectories. Over the last decade, numerous different methods have been developed to solve the motion planning problem. However, many of these methods deal with only a very simplified - if any - model of vehicle dynamics. On one hand, the formulation of the trajectory planning problem in case of geometric, graph search or sampling based algorithms makes the consideration of the dynamic equations of vehicle motion very difficult. On the other hand, nonlinear optimization based algorithms can deal with even complex models of nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, but this goes at the expense of computational requirements, which endangers real-time applicability. This paper presents a method which is capable of the evaluation of trajectories planned by an arbitrary motion planning algorithm in sense of dynamical feasibility. A metrics is developed to qualify the trajectories in terms of their traceability for the vehicle under given working conditions. Based on the defined metrics, a threshold is developed to decide about the applicability of the trajectory. It is shown that the presented method is computationally much less demanding as an optimization-based motion planning algorithm, and can still be used to verify that the vehicle can drive on the planned trajectory even if the dynamics was not considered at the time of planning at all. The performance of the algorithm is examined with the help of computer simulations, and includes the consideration of real-time applicability.

To meet this objective, the torpedo must have a detection system to find out the target position.

    "[1391\t,0,0,\"The collision avoidance (CA) system is a pivotal part of the autonomous vehicle. Ability to navigate the vehicle in various hazardous scenarios demands reliable actuator interventions. In a complex CA scenario, the increased nonlinearity requires a dependable control strategy. For example, during collisions with a sudden appearing obstacle (i.e. crossing pedestrian, vehicle), the abrupt increment of vehicle longitudinal and lateral forces summation during the CA maneuver demands a system with the ability to handle coupled nonlinear dynamics. Failure to address the aforementioned issues will result in collisions and near-miss incidents. Thus, to solve these issues, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based path tracking strategy is proposed as the automated motion guidance for the host vehicle CA architecture. The system is integrated with the artificial potential field (APF) as the motion planning strategy. In a hazardous scenario, APF measures the collision risks and formulates the desired yaw rate and deceleration metrics for the path replanning. APF ensures an optimal replanned trajectory by including the vehicle dynamics into its optimization formulation. NMPC then acts as the coupled path and speed tracking controller to enable vehicle navigation. To accommodate vehicle comfort during the avoidance, NMPC is constrained. Due to its complexity as a nonlinear controller, NMPC can be time-consuming. Therefore, a move blocking strategy is assimilated within the architecture to decrease the system’s computational burden. The modular nature of the architecture allows each strategy to be tuned and developed independently without affecting each others’ performance. The system’s tracking performance is analyzed by computational simulations with several CA scenarios (crossing pedestrian, parked bus, and sudden appearing moving vehicle at an intersection).

In this paper, a learning-based control solution with guarantees for collision avoidance is proposed. The design problem is formed in a novel way through the division of the control problem, which leads to reduced complexity for achieving real-time computation. First, an environment model for the intersection was created based on a constrained quadratic optimization, with which guarantees on collision avoidance can be provided. A robust cruise controller for the autonomous vehicle was also designed. Second, the environment model was used in the training process, which was based on a reinforcement learning method. The goal of the training was to improve the economy of autonomous vehicles, while guaranteeing collision avoidance.

    "[1419\t,0,0,\"The engagement of a group of autonomous air vehicles against several targets is a major challenge in mission planning. This paper addresses the problem of cooperative flight path planning where the air vehicles should arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays, while minimizing the total mission time. This involves finding an optimal assignment of air vehicles to targets and generating trajectories in compliance with the kinematic constraints of the vehicles. The trajectories have to avoid nofly-areas, threats and other obstacles, and must prevent the air vehicles from colliding with each other. The presented algorithm for simultaneous arrival first calculates shortest flight paths between all pairs of air vehicles and targets using a network-based routing model. An optimal assignment and a critical path is found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem with costs corresponding to the lengths of the shortest paths. The other flight paths are prolongated to the length of the critical path by automatic insertion of waypoints. This is achieved by concatenating subpaths stored in different shortest-path-trees. Due to the special structure of the network, all concatenated flight paths are flyable and feasible. Sequential arrival at a target is realized by sorting the flight paths according to their lengths and prolongating them whenever necessary to accomplish the desired time delays.

Emerging studies have conducted the crash risk analyses using discrete and aggregated traffic data (e.g., loop detector data, probe vehicle data), where crash events were selected as the prediction target. However, traditional traffic sensing data obtained at segment level cannot describe the detailed operation conditions for the vehicle platoons near crash locations. Thus, more microscopic and high-resolution traffic sensing data are needed. In addition, considering the random occurrence feature of crashes, high-risk events should be paid more attentions given their higher occurrence probability and consistent causations with crashes, which could proactively reduce crash likelihood.

First, high-risk events were obtained using safety surrogate measures with Modified Time to Collision (MTTC) less than 2 s.

Among which, the RPLR model was showed to have the best fitness and prediction accuracy. The results showed that the disturbed traffic flows in both longitudinal and lateral directions have positive impacts on high-risk events occurrence. Besides, too close following distance between vehicles would lead to high-risk events. Moreover, RPLR models could provide a high prediction accuracy of 97 % for 2 s ahead of the high-risk events.

This is beyond human capabilities and requires the support of automation tools to predict aircraft state throughout the operation and provide support to optimal decision making long before any potential conflict may arise. This is achieved with trajectory predictors and conflict detectors and resolvers respectively. Numerous tools have been developed, typically geared towards addressing specific airborne applications.

This article extends the invariant-set motion planner to systems with persistently varying disturbances and parametric model uncertainty. This is accomplished by replacing the previously used positive invariant sets with robust positive invariant sets. Since the model uncertainty obfuscates the relationship between the invariant sets in the state space, and the references and obstacles in the output space, we reformulate the dynamics in velocity form so that the system output appears directly in the modified system state. Since the persistently varying disturbances will prevent the closed-loop system from converging to the desired reference, we introduce a new robust connection rule where references are connected when the invariant set of one reference contains the minimal volume robust invariant-set of another. In addition, we bound the time required to transition between invariant sets to ensure safety when the obstacles are moving. By parameterizing the invariant sets using a precomputed input-to-state Lyapunov function, we reduce the real-time computational complexity of our motion planner.

Yet accident rates by unit of distance traveled in conventional traffic are extremely small quantities. The demonstration of safety enhancement by automation of the driving is currently actively debated. Even basic longitudinal motion planning, i.e. adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, require rigorous demonstration of their safety. Classical linear speed planners are feedback and relaxation processes for the time gap, based on the distance ahead and the speed of the preceding vehicle. Their active safety is tackled thanks to stability analysis. Generally speaking, stability occurs if the relaxation is sufficiently strong. Unfortunately, the acceleration rates and jerks with stable classical speed planners can exceed the bounds recommended by the ISO standard and lead to unsafe dynamics.

    "[1464\t,0,0,\"The motion control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has got more and more attention because AUV has been used in many applications in recent years. In order to find the optimal path for AUV to reach the specified destination in complex undersea environment, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Due to the various constraints, such as the limited energy and limited visual distance, the improved ACO algorithm uses improved pheromone update rule and heuristic function based on PSO algorithm to make AUV find the optimal path by connecting the chosen nodes of the undersea environment while avoiding the collision with the complex undersea terrain (static obstacles). The improved ACO algorithm based on PSO algorithm can overcome disadvantages of the traditional ACO algorithm, such as falling into local extremum, poor quality, and low accuracy.

    "[1465\t,0,0,\"The motion control problem of autonomous vehicles is reviewed. From the perspective of model, algorithm, and control structure, the domestic and foreign research progress is reviewed at three levels of longitudinal motion control, path following and trajectory tracking control, and the development prospect of motion control technology for autonomous vehicles is proposed. The current motion control research mainly focuses on normal conditions. In order to realize the potential of autonomous vehicles in handling critical scenarios that human drivers find challenging or lack the ability to navigate, it is necessary to extend the research to extreme working conditions. However, the properties of non-linearity and multi-dimensional coupled dynamics are significantly enhanced in extreme working conditions. The requirements of system modeling and adaptability and robustness of motion control algorithm are further increased. At the same time, in order to deal with the multi-objective coordination in complex scenarios, the integration of motion planning and control considering environmental uncertainty needs to be studied in depth. Adding actuators can increase the lateral response speed and control margin, but the research of control allocation of redundant and heterogeneous actuators is still to be broken through. The realization of motion control depends on road adhesion coefficient, sideslip angle, etc. Therefore, it is urgent to solve the problem of key state and parameter estimation under multi-source sensor information fusion.

    "[1466\t,0,0,\"The motion coordination problem for a fleet of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in a confined industrial facility is addressed. The working scenario involves a group of AGVs that is tasked to transport without collisions to predefined locations within the industrial facility. We introduce a centralized motion coordination controller that utilizes a dynamic priority logic to resolve motion conflicts between AGVs as they appear. The controller relies on the implementation of a predefined, virtual transportation network that is comparable to a conventional right-handed bidirectional traffic system. The construction of the transportation network considers the physical and motion characteristics of the AGVs (dimensions and maximum speed). The high-level function of the controller is to detect imminent collisions and determine the right-of-way of conflicting AGVs in same-directional routes and intersection junctions of the transportation network. The priority update logic is inspired by the traffic control of conventional four-way stop-controlled intersections. Based on the updated priorities, the motion coordinator adjusts the advancement of the AGVs to eliminate collisions. The proposed formulation combines a high-level event-driven logic for collision avoidance with low-level feedback control laws for guidance and navigation. As a result, the controller relies only on real-time measurements, removing the need for computationally demanding look-ahead predictions (heuristics) of the AGVs’ motion. It is shown that the proposed method ensures collision- and blockage-free motion of a large number of AGVs.

    "[1467\t,0,0,\"The motion planners used in self-driving vehicles need to generate trajectories that are safe, comfortable, and obey the traffic rules. This is usually achieved by two modules: behavior planner, which handles high-level decisions and produces a coarse trajectory, and trajectory planner that generates a smooth, feasible trajectory for the duration of the planning horizon. These planners, however, are typically developed separately, and changes in the behavior planner might affect the trajectory planner in unexpected ways. Furthermore, the final trajectory outputted by the trajectory planner might differ significantly from the one generated by the behavior planner, as they do not share the same objective. In this paper, we propose a jointly learnable behavior and trajectory planner. Unlike most existing learnable motion planners that address either only behavior planning, or use an uninterpretable neural network to represent the entire logic from sensors to driving commands, our approach features an interpretable cost function on top of perception, prediction and vehicle dynamics, and a joint learning algorithm that learns a shared cost function employed by our behavior and trajectory components.

First, the interpolation model was built using the electric drive actuator's data specifications. These data are the torque, speed, and efficiency for scattered steady-state operation points. The interpolation model builds the efficiency surface vs. torque and speed, which passes through all specification points of the actuator. If the required trajectory is superposed on the efficiency surface, we can find the incremental values of the efficiency which correspond to trajectories speed and torque.

    "[1491\t,0,0,\"The paper describes a combined survey campaign using an unmanned surface vehicle and integrating a side scan sonar and two magnetometers in a gradiometer set-up in very shallow water of the coastal transition zone from land to water. For the survey several areas have to be covered to provide an unexploded ordnance clearance for identifying places suitable for positioning of a jack-up barge needed for a subsequent offshore drilling campaign. Next to the limited water depth the necessary small line spacing especially for the magnetometer measurements were challenging. In that way, the paper discusses the adaptation of the necessary modules for guidance, navigation and control of the vehicle to run the survey campaign with a reliable coverage of the measurement area. Therefore, methods and applications are presented used for path planning, straight line path following, sensor integration and fusion as well as vehicle motion control. Further, the paper describes the connection between the modules to establish the entire closed system. In addition, the paper gives an overview about the requirements the survey campaign and the specified instrumentation as well as the resulting vehicle set-up. Especially the unconventional installation of the magnetometers was essential for the measurements in very shallow water.

    "[1497\t,0,0,\"The paper shows the novel way of detecting the obstacles, so that the intelligence of the autonomous vehicle (AV) can be enhanced for the path planning module. Path planning in cluttered environment has been considered as the main challenge in the field of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles need to be intelligent enough to recognize their surroundings and avoid the obstacles effectively. In cluttered environment, the AV requires the comprehensive perception of the environment to avoid the obstacles. So it is better to know about the kinematic behaviour of the obstacles while planning their path. Hence, the orientation of moving obstacle is estimated based on comparing the 3D range images between successive time frames. These 3D range information are acquired from a single vision sensor. The paper uses the differential scene flow technique to extract the flow vectors in 3D coordinates. Gradient Vector Field (GVF) method is utilized effectively in scene flow to extract changes in pixel values in the three directions which are used to recognize the obstacles. Our aim is to develop an autonomous path planning algorithm with closed-loop motion control based on scene flow which rely on a single vision sensor and an on-board hardware.

    "[1499\t,1,1,\"The past decade has witnessed continuous growth of naturalistic driving studies (NDSs). When analysing NDS data, safety-critical events (SCEs) are commonly used as surrogates for safety, since actual crashes are very rare. However, the association between SCEs and crashes is not consistent in previous studies and has not been verified among commercial truck drivers. Based on routinely collected kinematic data from 31,828 truck drivers in a large commercial trucking company, this paper examines the association between four types of SCEs (headway, hard brake, collision mitigation, and rolling stability) and crashes, as well as injuries and fatalities. Compared to existing studies on the subject, that are based on up to about 2 million miles driven, our study involves an estimated 2.3 billion miles driven. Bayesian negative binomial models were applied to examine the association between three outcomes (crashes, injuries, and fatalities) and the four SCEs. It was found that a unit increase in the number of any type of SCEs per 10,000 miles was associated with 8.4% (95% credible interval (CI): 8.0–8.8%) increase in crashes per mile and 8.7% (95% CI: 4.8–13.6%) increase in the number of injuries per mile. The increase was different in different types of SCEs: 3.3% (95% CI: 2.6–4%) for headways, 8.1% (95% CI: 7.5–8.7%) for hard brakes, 50.4% (95% CI: 41.4–60%) for rolling stability, and 22.2% (95% CI: 19.8–24.5%) for collision mitigation. The results are consistent when stratified by different business units and driver types. This study provides statistically strong and robust evidence that SCEs are positively associated with crashes and injuries among commercial truck drivers.

Moreover, their stochastic extensions have enabled risk-aware path planning, which explicitly limits the probability of failure to a user-specified bound. However, a major challenge of those path planning methods is constraint violation between discrete time steps. In the existing approach, a path is represented by a sequence of waypoints and the safety constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) are imposed on waypoints. Therefore, the trajectory between waypoints could violate the safety constraints. A naive continuous-time extension results in unrealistic computation cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ensure constraint satisfaction between waypoints without employing a continuous-time formulation. The key idea is to enforce that the same inequality constraint is satisfied on any two adjacent time steps, under assumptions of polygonal obstacles and straight line trajectory between waypoints. The resulting problem encoding is MILP, which can be solved efficiently by commercial solvers. Thus, we also introduce novel extensions to risk-allocation path planners with improved scalability for real-world scenarios and run-time performance. While the proposed encoding approach is general, the particular emphasis of this paper is placed on the chance-constrained, nonconvex path-planning problem (CNPP).

The optimal path planning application demands to determine the collision free shortest and optimal path. There can be numerous possibilities that to find the path with optimal length based on different types of available obstacles during the path and different types of workspace environment. This research work aims to identify the optimum path from the initial source-point to final point for the unknown workspace environment consists of static obstacles. For this experimentation, swarm intelligence based hybrid concepts are considered as the work collaboration and intelligence behavior of swarm agents provides the resourceful solution of NP hard problems. Here, the hybridization of concepts makes the solution of problem more efficient. Among swarm intelligence concepts, cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is one of the efficient algorithms due to clever behavior and brood parasitic property of cuckoo birds. In this research work, two hybrid concepts are proposed. First algorithm is the hybridized concept of cuckoo search with bat algorithm (BA) termed as CS-BAPP. Another algorithm is the hybridized concept of cuckoo search with firefly algorithm (FA) termed as CS-FAPP. Both algorithms are initially tested on the benchmarks functions and applied to the path planning problem. For path planning, a real time dataset area of Alwar region situated at Rajasthan (India) is considered. The selected region consists of urban and dense vegetation land cover features. The results for the optimal path planning on Alwar region are assessed using the evaluation metrics of minimum number of iterations, error rate, success rate, and simulation time.

    "[1519\t,0,0,\"The poor cruising range of electric vehicle (EV) is a problem preventing its popularity. To tackle this problem, methods such as battery technology, energy-based motion control technology are developed. This paper proposes a new solution from the perspective of path planning. Such a solution is called 3-D multi-object path planning method (3D-M method), in which both the energy consumption and distance are considered. The 3D-M method mainly realizes multi-object path planning by an energy consumption estimation model (ECEM) and a distance-integrated estimation model (DIEM). The ECEM can estimate the energy consumption between the neighbour position and the destination on the 3-D map, using a novel slope energy model considering energy consumption characteristic of the EV. The DIEM can estimate the integrated distance which includes the corresponding 2-D distance and 3-D distance, respectively. In the planning process, the outputs of ECEM and DIEM are combined to determine the cost of a path. In addition, a chaos-based multi-object optimizer (CBMOO) is used to search the optimal weights for the 3D-M method. The simulation experiments prove that the proposed method can generate an optimal path which saves much energy in comparison with the path provided by the distance-based method. IEEE\"],\n",

    "[1542\t,0,0,\"The reference path played a very important role in the parking schemes. In this paper, an arc tangent liked polynomial trajectory model is proposed, and an optimal trajectory is obtained for automatic parallel parking based on genetic algorithm, which ensures that the vehicle does not collide with obstacles or other vehicles during parking. The proposed algorithm has strong robustness because of that all the parameters of the vehicle and the parallel parking spaces are parameterized. Using the trajectory model with the vehicle and parking space parameters, a cost function with multi-constraints, were established for path planning. The start and end points of the planning trajectory are the actual starting point and the desired final parking point of the vehicle by choosing three parameters of the trajectory model appropriately. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Copyright © 2015 SAE International.\"],\n",

Such kind of robots requires very high stable and accurate controllers because their mobility is particularly influenced by wheel–ground interactions. Hence, the vehicle dynamics should be incorporated in the control circuit to take into account these issues, which is developed based on the road geometry parameters and the slippage-friction conditions at the wheel–ground contacts. Relying on this dynamic model, we present in this paper the design and application of a constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC). It is based on the minimization of a cost function (optimizing the deviation from the reference trajectory, and the variation of the control input) along a finite prediction horizon, however, the prediction horizon is variable according to the forward speed of the robot. On the other hand, this approach incorporates several constraints, essentially important for the stability and safety of an off-road mobile robot moving at the high velocity, namely: saturation and maximum variations of the vehicle's actuators (i.e. steering joints and their speeds limits) as well as the tire adhesion zone bounds (allowing to validate the assumption of a linear tire model). The full optimization problem is formulated as a Linearly Constrained Quadratic Programming (QP) to compute at each time-step the optimal and dynamically-consistent front and rear steering angles that are required to reach the desired path, with respect to all these constraints. The capabilities of our proposed controller are compared with another control law which does not apply any physical or intrinsic constraints. The latter is simply a feedback controller based on the same dynamic model and LQR theory (Linear Quadratic Regulator).

Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle's dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor.

To achieve this, we investigate the long-Term trajectories of inexpensive and underactuated drifting vehicles called drifters. These vehicles drift passively with ambient ocean currents. Vertical actuation (buoyancy) enables them to alter their depth and achieve controllability by the use of different current layers in the ocean. We aim to utilize these persistent assets to explore oceanic regions exhaustively; patrolling the surface, covering a 3-D phenomenon (e.g., algal bloom), or examining the seafloor with downward-facing cameras. In this article, we present a data-driven deployment and planning approach for the drifters. We extract the generalized flow pattern within a given region from ocean model predictions, develop a Markov chain-based motion model, and analyze the water flow behavior. Given an initial deployment location of the drifter on the water surface and the flow patterns within the region, our approach finds attractors and their transient groups at different depths as the persistent behavior of the environment. We then determine a minimum number of deployment locations for the drifters using these attractors and their transient groups. All possible reachable locations from the initial deployment location of the drifter are determined as its planned, long-Term drifter trajectory based on the computed attractors and transient groups. An optimal navigation policy is developed to demonstrate the best possible action from any location to a goal location in the environment. Our simulation results based on data from ocean model predictions validate the variability in the persistent behavior of the environment and the long-Term trajectory of the drifter over space and time.

    "[1562\t,1,1,\"The time-triggered communication paradigm has been shown to satisfy temporal isolation while providing end to end delay guarantees through the synthesis of an offline schedule. However, this paradigm has severe flexibility limitations as any unpredicted change not anticipated by the schedule, such as a component failure, might result in a loss of frames. A typical solution is to use redundancy or replace and update the schedule offline anew. With the ever increase in size of networks and the need to reduce costs, supplementary solutions that enhance the reliability of such networks are also desired. In this paper, we introduce a repair algorithm capable of reacting to unpredicted link failures. The algorithm quickly modifies the schedule such that all frames are transmitted again within their timing guarantees. We found that the success of our algorithm increases significantly with the existence of empty slots spread over the schedule, an opposite approach compared to packing frames, commonly used in the literature. We propose a new ILP formulation that includes a maximization of frame and link intermissions to stretch empty slots over the schedule. Our results show that we can repair with 90% success rate within milliseconds to a valid schedule compared to a few minutes needed to re-schedule the whole network. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

In this work, we introduced a policy-guided trajectory planner and proposed a hierarchical structure to try to solve these problems. The high-level DRL agent's output is policies that are considered as suggestions for the low-level policy-guided trajectory planner. To achieve the guarantee of safety, we first translated the traffic rules and policies into formal specifications. Notice that, in many cases, the policy may not be possible to be fully applied. Given certain formal specifications, we constructed a minimum-violation motion planning problem for the low-level policy-guided trajectory planner. Through this hierarchical structure, the long-term uncertainty is handled by the high-level DRL agent, and the safety is guaranteed by the low-level planner. Furthermore, the reward includes not only the violation of traffic rules but also the violation of policies.

The database includes maximum rolling angle, velocity vector, position scalar, and steering time data during the turning process. In emergency collision avoidance planning, the expected steering angle is obtained based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), and the solution space, with initial velocity and rudder angle taken as independent variables, is determined by combining the steering time and rolling angle data. On the basis of this solution space, the objective function is solved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the optimal initial velocity and rudder angle are obtained.

    "[1592\t,1,1,\"There is currently a huge interest around autonomous vehicles from both industry and academia. This is mainly due to recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, allowing the development of promising methods for autonomous driving. The gap toward full autonomy is incrementally being reduced with essentially three main existing approaches. First, Modular systems that combine a pipeline of methods with each solving one specific sub-task of driving. Second, Direct Perception techniques that directly estimate affordances (car orientation, distances between lane borders, etc) used to compute control commands through a simple logic. Finally, end-to-end frameworks that automatically map raw sensor data to actuation values.

    "[1593\t,0,0,\"There is extensive literature on using convex optimization to derive piece-wise polynomial trajectories for controlling differential flat systems with applications to three-dimensional flight for Micro Aerial Vehicles. In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1594\t,0,0,\"There is increasing interest in the deployment and operation of multiple autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) for a number of challenging scientific and commercial operational mission scenarios. Some of the missions, such as geotechnical surveying and 3D marine habitat mapping, require that a number of heterogeneous vehicles operate simultaneously in small areas, often in close proximity of each other. In these circumstances safety, reliability, and efficient multiple vehicle operation are key ingredients for mission success. Additionally, the deployment and operation of multiple AMVs at sea are extremely costly in terms of the logistics and human resources required for mission supervision, often during extended periods of time. These costs can be greatly minimized by automating the deployment and initial steering of a vehicle fleet to a predetermined configuration, in preparation for the ensuing mission, taking into account operational constraints. This is one of the core issues addressed in the scope of the Widely Scalable Mobile Underwater Sonar Technology project (WiMUST), an EU Horizon 2020 initiative for underwater robotics research.WiMUST uses a team of cooperative autonomous marine robots, some of which towing streamers equipped with hydrophones, acting as intelligent sensing and communicating nodes of a reconfigurable moving acoustic network. In WiMUST, the AMVs maintain a fixed geometric formation through cooperative navigation and motion control. Formation initialization requires that all the AMVs start from scattered positions in the water and maneuver so as to arrive at required target configuration points at the same time in a completely automatic manner. This paper describes the decoupled prioritized vehicle motion planner developed in the scope of WiMUST that, together with an existing system for trajectory tracking, affords a fleet of vehicles the above capabilities, while ensuring inter-vehicle collision and streamer entanglement avoidance. Tests with a fleet of seven marine vehicles show the efficacy of the system planner developed. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1595\t,0,0,\"This Paper presents a new quasi-steady in-ground effect (IGE) model for small multirotor aerial vehicles such as quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles. The model offers three major advances to the state of the art: 1) predicting the IGE thrust ratio without singularity, 2) relating the strength of the ground effect to the blade geometry (pitch angle, solidity, and radius), and 3) capturing the effect of multirotor configurations. Two IGE coefficients, based on blade element theory, are introduced and then analyzed using the method of images. Additionally, the thrust-loss phenomenon on multirotor IGE is observed and modeled empirically. Experiments are conducted to validate each component of the model, and the results suggest that the model can be used to predict the onset of the IGE for vehicle motion control and planning in the regime where IGE dominates. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\"],\n",

Furthermore, the image streams collected during the coverage task are post-processed using Structure from Motion, stereo SLAM and mesh reconstruction algorithms, while the resulting 3D mesh can be used for further visual inspection purposes.

In this context, we simply assume that the vehicle is a point mass unicycle such that the effect of the water column vortices can be controlled to contribute to the desired AUVs longitudinal and rotational velocities. The control action usually considered in the literature is extended by including the generation of vortices whose location and circulation are chosen at discrete points in time so the their effect on the AUV motion drives it between two given in an efficient way.

    "[1602\t,0,0,\"This article concerns the open question of creating control policies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that lead to courteous motion. The study is built on a two-agent interaction between two agents (M and H), where each agent plans its motion by optimizing a trade-off of goal fulfillment, safety, and courtesy losses. The paper has three contributions: First, the 'double-blindness' issue in intent inference, i.e., inferring H's intent requires knowledge about H's inference of M's intent, is addressed. An empathetic intent inference algorithm is proposed, where H's intent, along with its inference of M's intent, are jointly inferred. Second, vehicle dynamics is explicitly incorporated into intent inference to acknowledge its influence on decision making in driving by the drivers' knowledge about dynamical properties of surrounding vehicles. Lastly, a courtesy loss that leverages intent inference is introduced. This loss measures the expected additional loss to H caused by M's motion from a baseline where M behaves rationally and in favor of H. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that (1) joint inference and knowledge about vehicle dynamics are important to intent decoding and motion planning, and (2) the proposed courtesy definition leads to more rational motions than those from an existing definition. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

In this article, manual driving characteristics are investigated using real-world driving test data. In lane change situations, interactions with surrounding vehicles were mainly investigated.

    "[1607\t,0,0,\"This article discusses the highly autonomous robotic search and localization of radiation sources in outdoor environments. The cooperation between a human operator, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and an unmanned ground vehicle is used to render the given mission highly effective, in accordance with the idea that the search for potential radiation sources should be fast, precise, and reliable. Each of the components assumes its own role in the mission; the unmanned aerial vehicle (in our case, a multirotor) is responsible for fast data acquisition to create an accurate orthophoto and terrain map of the zone of interest. Aerial imagery is georeferenced directly, using an onboard sensor system, and no ground markers are required. The unmanned aerial vehicle can also perform rough radiation measurement, if necessary. Since the map contains three-dimensional information about the environment, algorithms to compute the spatial gradient, which represents the rideability, can be designed. Based on the primary aerial map, the human operator defines the area of interest to be examined by the applied unmanned ground vehicle carrying highly sensitive gamma-radiation probe/probes. As the actual survey typically embodies the most time-consuming problem within the mission, major emphasis is put on optimizing the unmanned ground vehicle trajectory planning; however, the dual-probe (differential) approach to facilitate directional sensitivity also finds use in the given context. The unmanned ground vehicle path planning from the pre-mission position to the center of the area of interest is carried out in the automated mode, similarly to the previously mentioned steps. Although the human operator remains indispensable, most of the tasks are performed autonomously, thus substantially reducing the load on the operator to enable them to focus on other actions during the search mission. Although gamma radiation is used as the demonstrator, most of the proposed algorithms and tasks are applicable on a markedly wider basis, including, for example, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear missions and environmental measurement tasks. © The Author(s) 2018.\"],\n",
    "[1608\t,0,0,\"This article discusses the rendezvous maneuver for a fleet of small fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Trajectories have to be generated on-line while avoiding collision with static and dynamic obstacles and minimizing rendezvous time. An approach based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is investigated which assures that the dynamic constraints of the UAVs are satisfied at every time step. By introducing binary variables, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is formulated. Computation time is limited by incorporating the receding horizon technique. A shorter planning horizon strongly reduces computation time, but delays detection of obstacles which can lead to an infeasible path. The result is a robust path planning algorithm that satisfies the imposed constraints. However, further relaxation of the constraints and fine-tuning is necessary to limit complexity. © 2017\"],\n",
    "[1609\t,0,0,\"This article focuses on the time-minimum path planning problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the constraint of simultaneous arrival in an ocean environment. The overall framework can be divided into two successive modules, and both of them are solved by the biased min-consensus (BMC) method, which introduces the edge weight into the standard min-consensus protocol. The first module plans each AUV's path under the BMC protocol, respectively, along which the AUV will avoid obstacles and navigate to the destination with the minimum time through the ocean current. Incorporating the cooperative constraint of simultaneous arrival, the second part chooses the AUV path with the maximal voyage time as a benchmark, and replans other AUVs' paths using the BMC method until their corresponding voyage time is approximately equal to the benchmark. The simulation results in various scenarios demonstrate the strong applicability and high effectiveness of our method. © 2007-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1611\t,0,0,\"This article presents a comparison of different path-planning algorithms for autonomous underwater vehicles using terrain-aided navigation. Four different path-planning methods are discussed: the genetic algorithm, the A* algorithm, the rapidly exploring random tree* algorithm, and the ant colony algorithm. The goal of this article is to compare the four methods to determine how to obtain better positioning accuracy when using terrain-aided navigation as a means of navigation. Each algorithm combines terrain complexity to comprehensively consider the motion characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicles, giving reachable path between the start and end points. Terrain-aided navigation overcomes the challenges of underwater domain, such as visual distortion and radio frequency signal attenuation, which make landmark-based localization infeasible. The path-planning algorithms improve the terrain-aided navigation positioning accuracy by considering terrain complexity. To evaluate the four algorithms, we designed simulation experiments that use real-word seabed bathymetry data. The results of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation by terrain-aided navigation in these four cases are obtained and analyzed. © The Author(s) 2019.\"],\n",
    "[1612\t,0,0,\"This article presents a computational framework to efficiently generate feasible and safe trajectories for multiple autonomous vehicle operations. We formulate the optimal motion planning problem as a continuous-time optimal control problem, and approximate its solutions in a discretized setting using Bernstein polynomials. The latter possess convenient properties that allow to efficiently compute and enforce constraints along the vehicles' trajectories, such as maximum speed and angular rates, minimum distance between trajectories and between the vehicles and known obstacles, etc. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for generating trajectories in real-time for safe operations in complex environments and multiple vehicle missions. We show, using a rigorous mathematical framework, that the solution to the discretized optimal motion planning problem converges to that of the continuous-time one. The advantages of the proposed method are investigated through numerical examples. © 1963-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1613\t,0,0,\"This article presents a framework and develops a formulation to solve a path planning problem for multiple heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) with uncertain service times for each vehicle-target pair. The vehicles incur a penalty proportional to the duration of their total service time in excess of a preset constant. The vehicles differ in their motion constraints and are located at distinct depots at the start of the mission. The vehicles may also be equipped with disparate sensors. The objective is to find a tour for each vehicle that starts and ends at its respective depot such that every target is visited and serviced by some vehicle while minimizing the sum of the total travel distance and the expected penalty incurred by all the vehicles. We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, present the theoretical properties of the formulation and advantages of using such a formulation, as opposed to a deterministic expected value formulation, to solve the problem.

    "[1614\t,0,0,\"This article presents a hierarchical path planning framework that allows to generate plans for autonomous vehicles in the presence of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. Contrasting many existing approaches, the hierarchical approach allows not only to resolve emergency situations, but also to consider regular settings. Planning is based on model predictive control (MPC), which allows to make optimal, anticipatory decisions based on forecasts of the intentions of VRUs while explicitly accounting for constraints. The VRU trajectory forecast is based on a polynomial least-squares approximation of the VRU's trajectories in combination with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network for prediction over a future horizon. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for two example scenarios. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1615\t,0,0,\"This article presents a new methodology for detecting road network and planning the path for vehicle motion using road map and satellite/aerial images. The method estimates road regions from based on network models, which are created from road maps and satellite images on the basis of using image-processing techniques such color filters, difference of Gaussian, and Radon transform. In the case of using the road map images, this method can estimate not only a shape but also a direction of road network, which would not be estimated by the use of the satellite images. However, there are some road segments that branch from the main road are not annotated in road map services. Therefore, it is necessary to detect roads on the satellite image, which is utilized to construct a full path for motion. The scheme of method includes several stages. First, a road network is detected using the road map images, which are collected from online maps services. Second, the detected road network is used to learn a model for road detection in the satellite images. The road network using the satellite images is estimated based on filter models and geometry road structures. Third, the road regions are converted into a Mercator coordinate system and a heuristic based on Dijkstra technique is used to provide the shortest path for vehicle motion.

    "[1616\t,1,1,\"This article presents a novel method for exactly reformulating nondifferentiable collision avoidance constraints into smooth, differentiable constraints using strong duality of convex optimization. We focus on a controlled object whose goal is to avoid obstacles while moving in an n -dimensional space. The proposed reformulation is exact, does not introduce any approximations, and applies to general obstacles and controlled objects that can be represented as the union of convex sets. We connect our results with the notion of signed distance, which is widely used in traditional trajectory generation algorithms. Our method can be applied to generic navigation and trajectory planning tasks, and the smoothness property allows the use of general-purpose gradient- and Hessian-based optimization algorithms. Finally, in case a collision cannot be avoided, our framework allows us to find 'least-intrusive' trajectories, measured in terms of penetration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on an automated parking problem, where our numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method is robust and enables real-time optimization-based trajectory planning in tight environments.

    "[1625\t,0,0,\"This brief presents a trajectory planning algorithm for aerial vehicles traveling in 3-D space while avoiding obstacles. The nature of the obstacles can be, for example, radar detection areas, cooperating and non-cooperating vehicles, and so on. Thus, it is a complex trajectory planning problem. The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT?) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT? algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT? algorithm. Moreover, the final solution obtained within a given number of iterations is closer to an optimal solution regarding the considered criterion. © 1993-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1626\t,0,0,\"This chapter addresses an approach to vehicle motion control based on using unstable modes. We introduce a notion of bifurcation parameter that can transform the vehicle's motion trajectory in the vicinity of obstacles by transforming them into repellers. Based on the proposed approach, an algorithm of simultaneous control and path planning is suggested. The numerical modeling results are given for the test scenes and for the environments with mobile obstacles. The performed research resulted in a modified method of control and motion planning in obstructed environments based on joint usage of unstable mode and the concept of a virtual goal point. The unstable mode and the virtual point are cohered by the bifurcation parameter. Computer modeling was performed for the obtained algorithms. The proposed approach allowed for the vehicle's functioning in a complicated obstructed environment using only the information about the distance to the detected obstacles. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

    "[1627\t,0,0,\"This chapter addresses the cooperative mission and path-planning problem of multiple UAVs in the context of the vehicle-routing problem. Since the conventional vehicle-routing algorithms approximate their path to straight lines to reduce computational load, the physical constraints imposed on the vehicle are not to be taken into account. In order to mitigate this issue, this chapter describes a framework allowing integrated mission and path planning for coordinating UAVs using the Dubins theory based on the differential geometry concepts which can consider non-straight path segments. The main advantage of this approach is that the number of design parameters can be significantly reduced while providing the shortest, safe, and feasible path, which leads to a fast design process and more lightweight algorithms. In order to validate the integrated framework, cooperative mission and path-planning algorithms for two missions are developed: (1) road-network search route-planning patrolling every road segment of interest efficiently based on the optimization and approximation algorithm using nearest insertion and auction negotiation and (2) communication-relay route planning between a ground control station and the friendly fleet satisfying the constraints on the UAV speed and the avoidance of nonflying zones. Lastly, the performance of the proposed algorithms is examined via numerical simulations. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.\"],\n",

    "[1638\t,0,0,\"This letter addresses the problem of vehicle path planning in the presence of obstacles and uncertainties, a fundamental robotics problem. While several path planning algorithms have been proposed over the years, many of them have dealt with only deterministic environments or with only open-loop uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty of the system state is not controlled and, typically, increases with time because of exogenous disturbances. This may lead to potentially conservative nominal paths. The typical approach to deal with disturbances and reduce uncertainty is to use a lower level feedback controller. We advocate the premise that, if a path planner can consider the closed-loop evolution of the system uncertainty, it can lead to less conservative, but still feasible, paths. To this end, in this letter, we develop an approach that is based on optimal covariance steering, which explicitly steers the state covariance for stochastic linear systems.

    "[1654\t,0,0,\"This paper addresses path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with remote sensing capabilities (or wireless communication capabilities). The goal of the path planning is to find a minimum-flight-time closed tour of the UAV visiting all executable areas of given remote sensing and communication tasks; in order to incorporate the nonlinear vehicle dynamics, this problem is regarded as a dynamically-constrained traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods. To obtain a close-to-optimal solution for the path planning in a tractable manner, a sampling-based roadmap algorithm that embeds an optimal control-based path generation process is proposed. The algorithm improves the computational efficiency by reducing numerical computations required for optimizing inefficient local paths, and by extracting additional information from a roadmap of a fixed number of samples. Comparative numerical simulations validate the efficiency of the presented algorithm in reducing computation time and improving the solution quality compared to previous roadmap-based planning methods. © 2017 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.\"],\n",

A practical vehicle-manipulator coordinated plan and control methodology of the UBVMS for autonomous interventions are designed. First, the system configuration is introduced, and the optimal work space is confirmed. Then, the control framework of the UBVMS mainly consisting of online motion planning, multitask kinematic control, dynamic feedforward compensation, and adaptive parameter undulatory control for autonomous manipulation is presented. The online motion planning method with resort to tracking differentiator is developed to produce desired task trajectory and reference rate. The singularity-robust multitask kinematic control algorithm with state observers is designed to obtain system reference velocity. The couple influence on the vehicle induced by the presence of the manipulator is described as the dynamic feedforward compensation signal to reduce undesired waggle of the UBVMS. Adaptive parameter modifier of the biomimetic propulsor is designed to satisfy multifarious performance requirements in different motion phases. Finally, pool experiments in multiple scenarios for autonomous grasping manipulation are conducted to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the developed coordinated plan and control strategy. © 1982-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1656\t,0,0,\"This paper addresses the challenge of safe path planning for autonomous vehicles at intersections. Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) as an effective local motion planning methodology has the ability to determine a feasible path. As the number of sampled positions increases, the probability of finding an optimal path increases. However, RRT is usually applied to the static environment due to its delay or lack of efficiency in planning a path to the goal area. In dynamic environments, redundant sampling positions near dynamic obstacles are not effective. Therefore, we proposed a methodology, pRRT, that combines Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) and RRT to generate a local path to guide the vehicle through the intersection. The procedure includes two phases: prediction and planning. Under prediction, GPR predicts the vehicle's future trajectory points. The prediction results are combined with destination position (intersection exit) to generate a probability map for sampling such that position sample quality is increased by avoiding redundant samples. The optimal strategy is deployed to guarantee the trajectory is collision-free in both current and future time instances. A combination of both proposed improvements can thus result in a path that is collision-free under the dynamic intersection area. The proposed method also increased the speed of path generation compared to the RRT algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.\"],\n",

The paper's main proposals are decomposed into two main parts: Firstly, the proposition of reliable and flexible components to perform short and long-term planning: at beginning, a generic and safe path planning-based on Parallel Elliptic Limit-Cycle (PELC) and its multi-criteria optimization (PELC?) have been proposed to perform either reactive or cognitive navigation. Afterward, it is proposed to suitably sequence several PELC/PELC? in order to obtain an optimal g lobal path-based on PELC (gPELC?). Secondly, this paper proposes an overall Hybrid (reactive/cognitive) multi-controller architecture for autonomous navigation using PELC? and gPELC?. This architecture has been designed in order to use a uniform set-points convention and a common control law to perform several sub-tasks (e.g., obstacle avoidance, target reaching/tracking, path following, etc.).

    "[1661\t,0,0,\"This paper addresses the motion planning problem using hybrid symbolic techniques. The proposed approach develops a unified hierarchical hybrid control framework using a bismulation-based abstraction technique over the partitioned motion space that can be applied to autonomous aerial robots (3-D symbolic motion planning) or ground vehicles (2-D symbolic motion planning). The bisimulation relation between the abstracted model and the original continuous system guarantees that their behaviors are the same. This allows to design a discrete supervisor for the abstracted model, and then, the designed supervisor can be applied to the original system while the closed-loop behavior does not change. To apply the discrete supervisor to the original continuous system, an interface layer is developed, which on the one hand translates discrete commands of the supervisor to a continuous form applicable to the continuous plant and on the other hand, abstracts the continuous signals of the continuous low layer to discrete symbols understandable by the supervisor. The proposed algorithm is verified through implementation of a hybrid symbolic algorithm for the formation control of unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2014 Chinese Automatic Control Society and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.\"],\n",

Three different path planners are presented and compared: a graph-search algorithm called Homotopic A?

Our method is decoupled into first offline selection of optimal orbits, followed by online coordinated attitude planning. In the orbit selection stage, we numerically evaluate the upper and lower bounds of the information gain for a discretized set of passive relative orbits (PRO). The algorithm then sequentially assigns orbits to each spacecraft using greedy heuristics. For the attitude planning stage, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) based attitude planner capable of addressing vehicle and sensor constraints such as attitude control system specifications, sensor field of view, sensing duration, and sensing angle.

We build a stochastic Markov decision process (MDP) model to represent the behaviors of the vehicles. This MDP model takes into account the road geometry and is able to reproduce more diverse driving styles. We introduce a new concept, namely, the 'dynamic cell,' to dynamically modify the state of the traffic according to different vehicle velocities, driver intents (signals), and the sizes of the surrounding vehicles (i.e., truck, sedan, and so on). We then use Bézier curves to plan smooth paths for lane switching. The maximum curvature of the path is enforced via certain design parameters. By designing suitable reward functions, different desired driving styles of the intelligent vehicle can be achieved by solving a reinforcement learning problem. The desired driving behaviors (i.e., autonomous highway overtaking) are demonstrated with an in-house developed traffic simulator. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1676\t,0,0,\"This paper aims to find a reliable, collision-free path in a dynamic environment for highly maneuverable unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). Given the real-time nature of the operational scenario, quick and adaptable reactions of UCAVs are necessary for updates in situational awareness. Therefore, we propose a three dimensional (3D) path planning approach based on the situational space to provide the tactical requirements of UCAVs for tracking targets and avoiding collisions. First, to ensure reliable nonlinear measurements, the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm based on a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is chosen for the tracking and prediction algorithm. A constraint reference frame combining the kinematic model of constant acceleration (CA) is developed to solve the problem of arrival point generation. Second, by analyzing the relative motion between the UCAV and the moving objects, we define the situation space and give the corresponding calculation method. In tracking the moving target, the guidance vector contains the fusion information of displacement and velocity. At the same time, taking advantage of the one-step situation space as the judgment of the threat, we further plan the collision avoidance strategy. Third, as the safety in a practically reachable trajectory of the UCAV possesses the absolute priority, the collision avoidance acceleration accounts for this dominant factor in path planning. Simulations and experimental results prove that the proposed approach can plan a smooth and flyable path in 0.008 s under the premise of soft-landing target tracking. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.\"],\n",

The path of the vehicle is predicted by using Machine Vision (MV) and Neural networks (NN) model. The NN model uses numerous amounts of training data. First the system works by using the MV algorithms to detect objects with predefined colors. Then, the location of the object is fed to the trained NN to get the speeds of the motors needed to reach the object. The training data are obtained from the manual driving of the vehicle in different experiment settings. In this paper, the neural model is compared with two other methods: object detection using MV model and fuzzy logic (FL) model to prove the efficiency of the neural model. All the three models depend on the live record of the camera board and its fast detection of objects using MV algorithms.

    "[1680\t,0,0,\"This paper attempts to develop a unified receding horizon optimization (RHO) scheme for the integrated path planning and tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Considering that the effective sensing range of onboard sensors is practically short, we formulate the path planning into RHO problems with the spline path template. The planned path is subsequently viewed as the state trajectory of a virtual reference system having the same kinematic and dynamic properties as the AUV's. Appropriately constructed error dynamics makes the AUV tracking control equivalent to the regulation problem of the error dynamic system,which facilitates the derivation of theoretical results via nonlinear MPC techniques. The model predictive control (MPC) tracking controller is designed so that closed-loop stability can be ensured. Due to the inherent RHO nature, both the path planning and tracking control are incorporated into an unified scheme.

Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed method can be used to improve the lower bounds of instances with four vehicles and 40 targets by approximately 39%.

The proposed real-Time path planner is capable of finding the optimal, collision-free path for a non-holonomic unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in an unstructured environment. First, a hybrid A? path planner is designed to find the optimal path through connecting the current position of the UGV to the target in real-Time while avoiding any obstacles in the vicinity of UGV. The advantages of the developed path planner are that, by using the potential field techniques and by excluding the nodes surrounding every obstacles, it significantly reduces the search space of the traditional A? approach; it is also capable of distinguishing different types of obstacles by giving them distinct priorities based on their natures and safety concerns. Such an approach is essential to guarantee a safe navigation in the environment where humans are in close contact with autonomous vehicles.

    "[1721\t,0,0,\"This paper describes a real-time motion planner based on the drivers’ visual behavior-guided rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) approach, which is applicable to on-road driving of autonomous vehicles. The primary novelty is in the use of the guidance of drivers’ visual search behavior in the framework of RRT motion planner. RRT is an incremental sampling-based method that is widely used to solve the robotic motion planning problems. However, RRT is often unreliable in a number of practical applications such as autonomous vehicles used for on-road driving because of the unnatural trajectory, useless sampling, and slow exploration. To address these problems, we present an interesting RRT algorithm that introduces an effective guided sampling strategy based on the drivers’ visual search behavior on road and a continuous-curvature smooth method based on B-spline. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle and verified against several different traffic scenarios.

    "[1723\t,0,0,\"This paper describes a real-time multi-vehicle motion planning (MVMP) algorithm for the emergency vehicle clearance task. To address the inherent limitations of human drivers in perception, communication, and cooperation, we require that the emergency vehicle and the surrounding normal vehicles are connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The concerned MVMP task is to find cooperative trajectories such that the emergency vehicle can efficiently pass through the normal vehicles ahead. We use an optimal-control based formulation to describe the MVMP problem, which is centralized, straightforward, and complete. For the online solutions, the centralized MVMP formulation is converted into a multi-period and multi-stage version. Concretely, each period consists of two stages: The emergency vehicle and several normal CAVs ahead try to form a regularized platoon via acceleration or deceleration (stage 1); when a regularized platoon is formed, these vehicles act cooperatively to make way for the emergency vehicle until the emergency vehicle becomes the leader in this local platoon (stage 2). When one period finishes, the subsequent period begins immediately. This sequential process continues until the emergency vehicle finally passes through all the normal CAVs. The subproblem at stage 1 is extremely easy because nearly all the challenging nonlinearity gathers only in stage 2; typical solutions to the subproblem at stage 2 can be prepared offline, and then implemented online directly. Through this, our proposed MVMP algorithm avoids heavy online computations and thus runs in real time. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

The key technique is optimization in a collision-free lane-changing trajectory cluster. To achieve this cluster, a tuning factor is first derived by optimizing a cubic polynomial. Then, a feasible trajectory cluster is generated by adjusting the tuning factor in a stable handling envelope defined from vehicle dynamics limits. Furthermore, considering the motions of surrounding vehicles, a collision avoidance algorithm is employed in the feasible cluster to select the collision-free trajectory cluster. To extract the optimal trajectory from this cluster, the TOPSIS algorithm is utilized to solve a multiobjective optimization problem that is subject to lane change performance indices, i.e., trajectory following, comfort, lateral slip and lane-changing efficiency. In this way, the collision risk is eliminated, and the lane change performance is improved.

The surround recognition system consists of three main modules: object classification, vehicle/non-vehicle tracking and dynamic drivable area determination. All system modules utilize information from potentially commercializable sensors such as vision sensors, radars, lidar and vehicle sensors. The objective of the motion planning module is to derive an optimal trajectory as a function of time and the surround recognition results.

In the case of moving objects such as other traffic participants, their behaviors are anticipated within the dynamic drivable area.

    "[1737\t,0,0,\"This paper describes the development of an optimized path planning algorithm for automated vehicles in urban environments. This path planning is developed on the basis of urban environments, where Cybernetic Transportation Systems (CTS) will operate. Our approach is mainly affected by vehicle's kinematics and physical road constraints. Based on this assumptions, computational time for path planning can be significantly reduced by creating an off-line database that already optimized all the potential trajectories in each curve the CTS can carry out. Therefore, this algorithm generates a database of smooth and continuous curves considering a big set of different intersection scenarios, taking into account the constraints of the infrastructure and the physical limitations of the vehicle. According to the real scenario, the local planner selects from the database the appropriate curves from searching for the ones that fit with the intersections defined on it. The path planning algorithm has been tested in simulation using the previous control architecture. The results obtained show path generation improvements in terms of smoothness and continuity. Finally, the proposed algorithm was compared with previous path planning algorithms for its assessment. © 2016\"],\n",

Moreover, a rollover-avoidance algorithm and a collision-avoidance algorithm containing a reaction time are presented to guarantee the lane-changing safety of automated vehicles, even in an emergent braking situation. The field lane-changing data from NGSIM data are used to construct a real traffic environment for lane-changing vehicles and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and CarSim is applied to investigate the traceability of the planned lane-changing trajectories using the proposed model. The results indicate that an automated vehicle can complete the lane-changing process smoothly, efficiently and safely following the trajectory planned by the proposed model, and the planned velocity and trajectory can be well-tracked by automated vehicles. © 2018\"],\n",

The robot consists of a vehicle unit and a 5-DOF manipulator, which equipped a torch at the end of manipulator. In order to finish the welding task, the kinematic motion planning strategy is of great importance. As the traditional strategy which uses inverse kinematic and polynomial interpolation may cause a waste of computing time, the screw theory is chosen to improve the strategy. From the simulation and experiment results, it can be found that the optimal motion planning method is reliable and efficient. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.\"],\n",
    "[1769\t,1,1,\"This paper focuses on the multi-vehicle motion planning (MVMP) problem for cooperative lane changes of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The predominant decentralized MVMP methods can hardly explore and utilize the cooperation capability of a multi-vehicle team, thus they usually lead to low-quality solutions. This paper proposes a two-stage MVMP framework to find high-quality online solutions. Concretely, at stage 1, the CAV platoon transfers from its original formation to a sufficiently sparse formation; at stage 2, all the CAVs simultaneously change lanes with collision avoidance implicitly ensured. The CAVs only involve longitudinal rather than lateral motions at stage 1, thus the collision-avoidance constraints can be easily handled. Since stage 2 begins with a sparse formation, the implicitly ensured collision avoidance can be completely omitted then. Through this, the proposed method avoids directly handling the challenging collision avoidance conditions, thereby being able to compute fast. As the vehicles run cooperatively and simultaneously at either stage, the obtained solutions are near-optimal. The completeness, effectiveness, and quality of the proposed two-stage MVMP method are validated through theoretical analysis and comparative simulations. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

The solution of the flow field is obtained by the method of computational fluid dynamics. The optimization layer generates a specific path and guarantees the feasibility of the path.

    "[1774\t,0,0,\"This paper focuses on the real-time trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles driving in realistic urban environments. To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules. © 1996-2012 IEEE.\"],\n",

The UAV trajectory planning problem is to compute an optimal or near-optimal trajectory for a UAV to do its mission objectives in a surviving penetration through the hostile enemy environment, considering the shape of the earth and the kinematics constraints of the UAV. Using the three dimensional terrain information, three dimensional flight path from a starting point to an end point, minimising a cost function and regarding the kinematics constraints of the UAV is calculated. The geographic information of the earth shape and enemy locations is generated using digital terrain model (DTM) and geographic information system (GIS), and is displayed in a 3D environment. Using 3D-maps containing the geographic data accompanied by DTM, and GIS, the problem is modelled by deriving the motion equations of the UAV. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed for this problem: genetic and particle swarm algorithms. Genetic and particle swarm algorithms are general purposes algorithms, because they can solve a wide range of problems, so they have to be adjusted to solve the trajectory planning problem.

However, the conventional vehicle-routing-based approaches for the CPP cannot capture a turning motion of the vehicle. This limitation of the arc-based mathematical model comes from the property of turning motions, which should be evaluated from two arcs because a turn motion occurs at a junction of the arcs. In this paper, to mitigate the limitation, a route-based model using column generation approach with a turn penalty is proposed.

    "[1787\t,0,0,\"This paper introduces an efficient motion planning method for on-road driving of the autonomous vehicles, which is based on the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm. RRT is an incremental sampling-based algorithm and is widely used to solve the planning problem of mobile robots. However, due to the meandering path, the inaccurate terminal state, and the slow exploration, it is often inefficient in many applications such as autonomous vehicles. To address these issues and considering the realistic context of on-road autonomous driving, we propose a fast RRT algorithm that introduces a rule-template set based on the traffic scenes and an aggressive extension strategy of search tree. Both improvements lead to a faster and more accurate RRT toward the goal state compared with the basic RRT algorithm. Meanwhile, a model-based prediction postprocess approach is adopted, by which the generated trajectory can be further smoothed and a feasible control sequence for the vehicle would be obtained. Furthermore, in the environments with dynamic obstacles, an integrated approach of the fast RRT algorithm and the configuration-time space can be used to improve the quality of the planned trajectory and the replanning. A large number of experimental results illustrate that our method is fast and efficient in solving planning queries of on-road autonomous driving and demonstrate its superior performances over previous approaches. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1789\t,1,1,\"This paper introduces and studies a graph-based variant of the path planning problem arising in hostile environments. We consider a setting where an agent (e.g. a robot) must reach a given destination while avoiding being intercepted by probabilistic entities which exist in the graph with a given probability and move according to a probabilistic motion pattern known a priori. Given a goal vertex and a deadline to reach it, the agent must compute the path to the goal that maximizes its chances of survival. We study the computational complexity of the problem, and present two algorithms for computing high quality solutions in the general case: an exact algorithm based on Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming, working well in instances of moderate size, and a pseudo-polynomial time heuristic algorithm allowing to solve large scale problems in reasonable time. We also consider the two limit cases where the agent can survive with probability 0 or 1, and provide specialized algorithms to detect these kinds of situations more efficiently. © 2020 AI Access Foundation.

The proposed algorithm is applicable to vehicles that can be modelled with differentially flat dynamics, like unicycle and bicycle kinematics. The main idea is to exploit the flatness property so as to finitely parametrize trajectories, and design a set of motion primitives that represent optimal constrained trajectories joining two configurations in a grid space. A procedure to determine constrained (though sub-optimal) trajectories joining arbitrary configurations based on the motion primitives is then proposed. This eases and accelerates the construction of the tree to the purpose of online trajectory (re)planning in an uncertain environment, where the obstacle map may be continuously updated as the vehicle moves around, or unexpected events may occur and alter the free configuration space. © 2017\"],\n",

By Lagrange principle, a four-independent-coordinate dynamic model, which can describe the multivariate, nonlinear, and underactuated characteristics of the system, is first proposed. Besides, a reduced order dynamic is developed in the following so as to tackle the nonholonomic problem, and then the three-independent-coordinate reduced order dynamic is divided into an actuated part constituted by the rotational subsystem, and an underactuated part combined by the longitudinal and the swing angle subsystems. The sliding mode control (SMC) technique is utilized to construct the controller; especially, a composite sliding mode surface is proposed which can realize the velocity tracking and oscillation suppression for pendular suspension simultaneously. Furthermore, the adaptive mechanism is employed to update the true values of the inaccessible physical parameters which can enhance the adaptability of the WPS vehicle in unstructured environment.

    "[1798\t,0,0,\"This paper investigates the feasibility of using pseudospectral (PS) optimal control in real-time path planning for marine surface vehicles in environments where both obstacles and unknown disturbances are present. In particular, the simplified kinematic equations of an underactuated marine surface vehicle exposed to unknown ocean currents are considered, and the software package DIDO is used to compute the optimal path via PS optimization, initially assuming the ocean current is zero. In that case, the resulting path is minimum-length (similar to Dubins path) but not minimum-time. The main contribution concerns the addition of a nonlinear observer, which estimates online the effects of the ocean current on the vehicle, and that of a guidance system which generates appropriate reference trajectories in order to minimize the position error and track the optimal trajectory successfully. It is shown that through occasional replanning, according to the information about the ocean current parameters coming from the observer, the updated path converges to the minimum-time path. Two different implementations of the approach are presented and illustrated through numerical simulations. © 2016\"],\n",

A novel approach of hierarchical fuzzy logic controller (HFLC) and particle swarm optimization is proposed.

When one or more targets are detected, the teams send a package of information to the ground station (GS) including the target's degree of threat, degree of importance, and the separating distance between each team and each detected target. First, the ground station assigns the teams to the targets based on the gathered information. HFLC is implemented in the GS to solve the assignment problem ensuring that each team is assigned to a unique target. Then, each team plans its own path by formulating the path planning problem as an optimization problem, while the objective is to minimize the time to reach their destination considering the UAVs dynamic constraints and the collision avoidance between teams.

    "[1812\t,0,0,\"This paper is concerned with path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying through low altitude urban environment. Although many different path planning algorithms have been proposed to find optimal or near-optimal collision-free paths for UAVs, most of them either do not consider dynamic obstacle avoidance or do not incorporate multiple objectives. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective path planning (MOPP) framework to explore a suitable path for a UAV operating in a dynamic urban environment, where safety level is considered in the proposed framework to guarantee the safety of UAV in addition to travel time. To this aim, two types of safety index maps (SIMs) are developed first to capture static obstacles in the geography map and unexpected obstacles that are unavailable in the geography map. Then an MOPP method is proposed by jointly using offline and online search, where the offline search is based on the static SIM and helps shorten the travel time and avoid static obstacles, while the online search is based on the dynamic SIM of unexpected obstacles and helps bypass unexpected obstacles quickly. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under the dynamic urban environment. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1813\t,0,0,\"This paper is concerned with the real-time path planning of AGVs in a cluttered environment. In order to perform real-time operations with limited processing resources, an efficient path-planning algorithm and identification of the obstacles by a single sensor are presented. For an AGV, path planning in a cluttered environment is a challenging task owing to its lack of information about the surroundings and its need to re-plan its path quickly whenever it senses obstacles nearby. Therefore, an efficient path-planning algorithm that offers an AGV sufficient time to re-plan its path to avoid moving obstacles is proposed and, to measure its computational efficacy, its time complexity is considered. In real-time experimentation of autonomous path-planning, AGV relies completely on perception system to sense the immediate environment and avoid obstacles when it traverses towards the goal. As the Time-of-Flight (ToF)-based PMD (Photonic Mixer Device) three dimensional (3D) sensor can provide range and intensity data at low computational cost, it is utilised as a single proprioceptive sensor to detect static and dynamic obstacles.

The UAV needs to fly over each UGV periodically to collect the information and then transmit the information to the other UGVs.

    "[1819\t,0,0,\"This paper outlines a predictive maneuver-planning method for autonomous vehicle navigating public highway traffic. The method integrates discrete maneuvering decisions, i.e., lane and reference speed selection automata, with a model predictive control-based motion trajectory-planning scheme. A key notion is to apply a predictive reference speed pre-planning for each lane at each time step of a selected prediction horizon. This is done based on the predicted likely motion of the autonomous vehicle and other object vehicles subject to sensor noise and environmental disturbances. Then, an optimization problem is configured that computes safe, sub-optimal plans for the trajectories of both the motion states (and inputs) and maneuver references for the prediction horizon to accomplish maneuvers like lane keeping, lane change, or obstacle avoidance. While a first formulation of the problem results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, it is shown that a relaxation can be adopted that reduces the computational complexity to a low-order polynomial time nonlinear program that can be solved more efficiently. Through simulation of a series of multi-lane highway scenarios and comparison with one-maneuver planning approach and an adaptive cruise control approach, the proposed predictive maneuver planning is illustrated to better accommodate the traffic environment with feasible execution time. Also, the reference speed pre-planning improves the optimality and the robustness of the maneuver decision in trajectory planning without adding computational complexity to the optimization problem. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",

For a 3D trajectory planning problem with timestamps information, due to the presence of multiple kinds of constraints, the feasible domain is non-convex, so it is easy to fall into local optimum for trajectory planning. And the solution space of this problem is so enormous that it is difficult to identify an optimal solution in polynomial time. To address this non-convex problem, and to improve the convergence speed of an optimization process, the approach based on lattice searching is adopted in consideration of the ability to discretize driving environments and reduce the solution space. And the resulting path generated by lattice searching typically lies in the neighborhood of the global optimum. But this solution is neither spatiotemporally smooth nor globally optimal, so it is generally called the rough solution. For this reason, a subsequent nonlinear optimization process is introduced to refine the rough trajectory (combined by path and speed).

To minimize the planning time, we adopt the idea of biasing the RRT tree-growth in more focused ways. We propose to calculate the skeleton of the 2D environment first, then connect a geometrical path on the skeleton, and grow the RRT tree via the seeds generated locally along this path. We conduct batched simulations to find the universal parameters in manipulating the seeds generation. We show that the proposed skeleton-biased locally-seeded RRT (skilled-RRT) is faster than the other baseline planners (RRT, RRT*, A*-RRT, Theta*-RRT, and MARRT) through experimental tests using different vehicles in different 2D building environments. Given mild assumptions of the 2D environments, we prove that the proposed approach is probabilistically complete. We also present an application of the skilled-RRT for unmanned ground vehicle. Compared to the other baseline algorithms (Theta*-RRT and MARRT), we show the applicability and fast planning of the skilled-RRT in real environment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\"],\n",
    "[1837\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a framework for fast and robust motion planning designed to facilitate automated driving. The framework allows for real-time computation even for horizons of several hundred meters and thus enabling automated driving in urban conditions. This is achieved through several features. Firstly, a convenient geometrical representation of both the search space and driving constraints enables the use of classical path planning approach. Thus, a wide variety of constraints can be tackled simultaneously (other vehicles, traffic lights, etc.). Secondly, an exact cost-to-go map, obtained by solving a relaxed problem, is then used by A?-based algorithm with model predictive flavour in order to compute the optimal motion trajectory. The algorithm takes into account both distance and time horizons. The approach is validated within a simulation study with realistic traffic scenarios. We demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to devise plans both in fast and slow driving conditions, even when full stop is required. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1838\t,1,1,\"This paper presents a framework for generating explicit quintic polynomial curves as the trajectory of autonomous vehicles. The method is called SCR-Normalize and is founded on two novel ideas. The first concept is to rotate the coordinate reference, regarding the boundary conditions, in order to reach a special coordinate reference called Secondary Coordinate Reference (SCR). In the SCR, the explicit quintic polynomial curve has short length and low curvature values (i.e. the curve is not wiggly). The second concept is to normalize the trajectory in order to speed up the framework. Two kinds of problems are considered to be solved in this paper: (a) generating a length optimal trajectory for arbitrary boundary conditions subject to a curvature constraint; and (b) path smoothing. For case (a), for the lane change manoeuvre, the problem is solved explicitly. In addition, the familiar expression for the optimal interval of the lane change manoeuvre is analytically proved for the first time. For arbitrary swerving manoeuvres, two algorithms are presented and their performance is compared with each other and with two other algorithms. Similarly, for case (b), an algorithm is presented and its performance is compared with three other methods. Evaluating the algorithms in the examples, and comparing the results with other methods illustrates the efficiency of the SCR-Normalize framework to generate optimal trajectories in real time. © IMechE 2020.\"],\n",
    "[1839\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a framework that integrates vector field based motion planning techniques with an optimal path planner. The main motivation for this integration is the solution of UAVs' motion planning problems that are easily and intuitively solved using vector fields, but are very difficult to be even posed as optimal motion planning problems, mainly due to the lack of clear cost functions. Examples of such problems include the ones where a goal configuration is not defined, such as circulation of curves, loitering and road following. While several vector field methodologies were proposed to solve these tasks, they are susceptible to failures in the presence of previously unmodeled obstacles, including no-fly zones specified during the flight. Our framework uses a vector field as a high level specification of a task and an optimal motion planner (in our case RRT - ) as a local, on-line planner that generates paths that follow the vector field, but also consider the new obstacles encountered by the vehicle during the flight. A series of simulations illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. One of these simulations considers a rotorcraft UAV equipped with a spinning laser patrolling an urban area in the presence of unmodeled obstacles and no-fly zones. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1842\t,1,0,\"This paper presents a generic approach for tactical decision-making under uncertainty in the context of driving. The complexity of this task mainly stems from the fact that rational decision-making in this context must consider several sources of uncertainty: The temporal evolution of situations cannot be predicted without uncertainty because other road users behave stochastically and their goals and plans cannot be measured. Even more important, road users are only able to perceive a tiny part of the current situation with their sensors because measurements are noisy and most of the environment is occluded. In order to anticipate the consequences of decisions a probabilistic approach, considering both forms of uncertainty, is necessary. We address this by formulating the task of driving as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be automatically optimized for different scenarios. As driving is a continuous-space problem, the belief space is infinite-dimensional. We do not use a symbolic representation or discretize the state space a priori because there is no representation of the state space that is optimal for every situation. Instead, we employ a continuous POMDP solver that learns a good representation of the specific situation. © 2014 IEEE.\"],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Specially, the list also stores the edge information of blocking obstacle. For the obstacles with short distance, a reasonable way to fly over is studied.

Cost functions considering driving comfort and energy consumption are applied to evaluate each candidate path and the optimal one will be selected as tracking reference afterwards. Re-determination of longitudinal horizon in terms of relative distance between ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles, together with update of speed profile, will be triggered for re-planning if candidate paths ahead fail the safety checking.

    "[1846\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a hierarchical trajectory planning based on the integration of a sampling and an optimization method for urban autonomous driving. To manage a complex driving environment, the upper behavioral trajectory planner searches the macro-scale trajectory to determine the behavior of an autonomous car by using environment models, such as traffic control device and objects. This planner infers reasonable behavior and provides it to the motion trajectory planner. For planning the behavioral trajectory, the sampling-based approach is used due to its advantage of a free-form cost function for discrete models of the driving environments and simplification of the searching area. The lower motion trajectory planner determines the micro-scale trajectory based on the results of the upper trajectory planning with the environment model. The lower planner strongly considers vehicle dynamics within the planned behavior of the behavioral trajectory. Therefore, the planning space of the lower planner can be limited, allowing for improvement of the efficiency of the numerical optimization of the lower planner to find the best trajectory. For the motion trajectory planning, the numerical optimization is applied due to its advantages of a mathematical model for the continuous elements of the driving environments and low computation to converge minima in the convex function.

The prediction results of each model of the IMM filter are fused to predict the future state of targets. The proposed predictor uses the intelligent driver model based-driver behavior model to construct the local filter of IMM. The driving mode decision is realized as a state machine consisting of two phases, 'Approach' and 'Risk Management'. The risk management phase is composed of two sub-modes, 'Cross' and 'Yield'. The state transition conditions between phases and modes are defined by introducing the concepts of 'Critical gap' and 'Follow-up gap'. Based on the determined driving mode, the motion planning module consists of two sub-modules for each phase. The required deceleration determination for the approach phase is proposed to consider the occluded region in order to prevent inevitable collisions caused by fast approaches.

Vehicles are dynamically routed using a controller based on a concept from artificial physics, where vehicle motion depends on the target probability at their location as well as the distance to nearby agents. In this paradigm, the inverse log-likelihood ratio represents temperature, i.e., high likelihood corresponds to cold temperature and low likelihood corresponds to high temperature. Vehicles move at a temperature-dependent speed along the negative gradient of the temperature surface while interacting locally with other agents via a Lennard-Jones potential in order to emergently transition between the three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas.

We propose solution based on fast D? lite algorithm for global path cost-to-go computation while employing MPC planning paradigm for solving constrained optimal control problem for the purpose of local planning. With this paradigm in use, both global, stationary, state of the environment, and local dynamics of the environment are taken into account in the near-optimal path planning. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[1865\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a multiobjective optimization approach for path planning of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). A unique feature of the technique is the unification of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) with good seamanship's practice along with hierarchical (rather than simultaneous) inclusion of objectives. The requirements of collision avoidance are formulated as mathematical inequalities and constraints in the optimization framework and thus collision-free manoeuvres and COLREGs-compliant behaviours are provided in a seafarer-like way. Specific expert knowledge is also taken into account when designing the multiobjective optimization algorithm. For example, good seamanship reveals that if allowed, an evasive manoeuvre with course changes is always preferred over one with speed changes in practical maritime navigation. As a result, a hierarchical sorting rule is designed to prioritize the objective of course/speed change preference over other objectives such as path length and path smoothness, and then incorporated into a specific evolutionary algorithm called hierarchical multiobjective particle swarm optimization (H-MOPSO) algorithm. The H-MOPSO algorithm solves the real-time path planning problem through finding solutions of the formulated optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed H-MOPSO algorithm is demonstrated through both desktop and high-fidelity networked bridge simulations. © 2000-2011 IEEE.\"],\n",

Even though significant advances have been made for autonomous navigation in structured terrain conditions, obtaining reliable traversability estimates for tracked vehicle navigation in challenging terrain conditions is still an open research problem. In this regard, we propose a neural network architecture capable of fusing depth images along with roll and pitch measurements on board the robot to perform traversability estimation. The proposed architecture is trained in a variety of simulated structured and unstructured environments. As such, the proposed architecture is capable of extracting the relevant features from the sensor measurements in a data driven manner as compared to existing heuristic based approaches that fail to generalize for different environmental conditions. The reliability of the traversability estimates provided by the trained architecture was validated in indoor and outdoor conditions using real sensor data. In addition, the feasibility of using the traversability estimates in incremental path planning was also demonstrated through simulation.

    "[1868\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a new approach for control synthesis of non-deterministic transition systems under Linear Temporal Logic specifications with applications to multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) motion planning problems. The consideration of such systems is motivated by the non-determinism possibly introduced while abstracting dynamical systems into finite transition systems. More precisely, we consider transition systems enhanced with a progress set describing the fact that the system cannot stay indefinitely in some subset of states. The control synthesis problem is firstly translated into a terminating planning problem. Then, a backward reachability strategy searches for a path from the initial set to the goal set. At each iteration, subsets of states contained in the progress set are added to the path, thus ensuring the reachability to the goal set in finite time. If a solution to the terminating problem is found, the obtained controller is translated back to the initial problem formulation.

    "[1869\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a new approach for motion planning in cluttered environment of an aerial robotic system with two arms for long reach manipulation (ARS-LRM). The motion planning problem is addressed considering jointly the aerial platform and the dual arm in order to achieve wider operating conditions. Since there exists a strong dynamical coupling between the multirotor and the dual arm, safety in obstacle avoidance will be assured by introducing dynamics awareness (DA) in the operation of the planner. On the other hand, the limited manoeuvrability of the system emphasizes the importance of energy and time efficiency in the generated trajectories. Accordingly, a RRT-based algorithm has been employed to guarantee their optimality. The joint exploration for the complete set of motion variables in the two ARS-LRM subsystems requires a significant computational effort which can be alleviated if only the position variables are considered in the search tree. In order to maintain the velocity as an additional exploration degree, a mechanism for Velocity Adaptation (VA) has been implemented.

The proposed approach involves the use of a single-beam LiDAR to estimate the terrain profile under uncertainty. The LiDAR is installed at the base of a quadrotor and can be set at different angles to send information to the quadrotor about undulations of the terrain ahead. This strategy helps the quadrotor to build a smooth trajectory for the UAV and allows the controller to follow it closely. In turn, maneuverability of UAVs over and around ground-based obstacles is improved significantly in comparison to typical default autopilot controllers programmed to maintain the UAV at a given altitude.

    "[1872\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a new method for motion planning under differential constraints by incorporating a numerically solved discretized representation of reachable state space for faster state sampling and nearest neighbor searching. The reachable state space is solved for offline and stored into a 'reachable map' which can be efficiently applied in online planning. State sampling is performed only over states encompassed by the reachable map to reduce the number of unsuccessful motion validity checking queries. The nearest neighbor distance function is revised such that only reachable states are considered, with states which are unreachable or only reachable beyond a designated time horizon disregarded. This method is generalized for application to any control system, and thus can be used for vehicle models where analytical solutions cannot be found. Greater improvement is expected for more constrained systems where motion checking cost is relatively high. Simulation results are discussed for case studies on a holonomic model and a Dubins car model, both with maximum speed limitation and time included as a dimension in the configuration space, where planning speed (measured by tree growth rate) can be improved through reachability guidance in each system by at least a factor of 3 and 9, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1877\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a novel Local-Path Planning approach for an independent four-wheel steering (I4WS) mobile base. The approach smoothly drives and rotates the platform while still following a given path and avoiding obstacles. I4WS vehicles are omnidirectional vehicles, similar to shopping carts, if one neglects the time needed to steer the wheels. However, due to the danger of mechanical parts breaking while actuating the wheels, they are commonly controlled in a stop-and-go fashion, where the vehicle stops to turn its wheels perpendicular to a desired instantaneous center of curvature (ICC) before starting to move again. The approach overcomes this limitation and ensures an ICC-based kinematic constraint during continuous motion using a flat-input controller running at 100 Hz. Therefore, the trajectory of the ICC is both predictable and suitable for model predictive control (MPC). The MPC implemented generates optimized collision-free trajectories of up to several meters ahead at 10 Hz, given a set of points along a path and laser contour readings. Furthermore, the planner realized here is able to deal with additional constraints such as the vehicle's view direction to focus on attention points while driving.

    "[1886\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a novel feedback method for the motion planning and coordination of multiple agents that belong to two classes, namely class-A and class-B. All agents are modeled via unicycle kinematics. Agents of class-B do not share information with agents of class-A and do not participate in ensuring safety, modeling thus agents with failed sensing/communication systems, agents of higher priority, or moving obstacles with known upper bounded velocity. The method is built upon a family of 2-D analytic vector fields, which under mild assumptions are proved to be safe feedback motion plans with a unique stable singular point. The conditions which ensure collision free and almost global convergence for a single agent and the analytical form of the vector fields are then utilized in the design the proposed distributed, semi-cooperative multi-agent coordination protocol. Semi-cooperative coordination has been defined in prior work as the ad hoc prioritization and conflict resolution among agents of the same class; more specifically, participation in conflict resolution and collision avoidance for each agent is determined on-the-fly based on whether the agent's motion results in decreasing its distance with respect to its neighbor agents; based on this condition, the agent decides to either ignore its neighbors, or adjust its velocity and avoid the neighbor agent with respect to which the rate of decrease of the pairwise inter agent distance is maximal. The proposed coordination protocol builds upon this logic and addresses the case of multiple agents of distinct classes (class-A and class-B) in conflict. Guarantees on the safety of the multi-agent system and the almost global convergence of the agents to their destinations are proved.

    "[1897\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a novel probabilistic approach for improving the motion planning performance of autonomous driving. The proposed approach is based on the sampling-based planning algorithm, which generates an optimal trajectory from a set of trajectory candidates. In order to treat the uncertainty in the perception data and the vehicle system, the particle filter framework is applied to the motion planning algorithm with four main steps: the time update of the trajectory candidates, the perception measurement update, the trajectory selection and the motion goal resampling. Since the proposed planning algorithm recursively generates an optimal trajectory, the time update of the trajectory candidate updates the motion goals of the trajectory candidates in the previous step using the vehicle model, and it also generates a new set of candidates. In order to evaluate the optimality of each candidate with regard to the safety and the reliability, a perception measurement update is performed. In this step, the importance weight of each candidate is computed using perception data and its adaptive likelihood function. Based on the candidates with updated importance weights, an optimal trajectory is determined in the trajectory selection. Then, the motion goal resampling modifies the set of motion goals based on the importance weights for efficient management of the motion goals in the iterative planning algorithm. The developed algorithm is validated using various types of test.

The algorithm generates smooth paths consisting of continuous piecewise Bézier curves in real time. Specifically, a RRT-based waypoint generation algorithm is firstly proposed for the exploration of collision-free waypoints successively during flight. Besides, a novel real-time path smoothing technique is developed to generate continuous collision-free paths that satisfy the motion constraints of UAVs. This is achieved by fitting Bézier curves between consecutive waypoints based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Lastly, a path selection strategy is also introduced to seek for an optimum path when multiple solutions are available.

    "[1919\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a risk-aware path planning strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in urban environments. The aim is to compute an effective path that minimizes the risk to the population, thus enforcing safety of flight operations over inhabited areas. To quantify the risk, the proposed approach uses a risk-map that associates discretized locations of the space with a suitable risk-cost. Path planning is performed in two phases: first, a tentative path is computed off-line on the basis on the information related to static risk factors; then, using a dynamic risk-map, an on-line path planning adjusts and adapts the off-line path to dynamically arising conditions. Off-line path planning is performed using riskA*, an ad-hoc variant of the A* algorithm, which aims at minimizing the risk. While off-line path planning has no stringent time constraints for its execution, this is not the case for the on-line phase, where a fast response constitutes a critical design parameter. We propose a novel algorithm called Borderland, which uses the check and repair approach to rapidly identify and adjust only the portion of path involved by the inception of relevant dynamical changes in the risk factor. After the path planning, a smoothing process is performed using Dubins curves. Simulation results confirm the suitability of the proposed approach. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.\"],\n",
    "[1920\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a robust motion planning methodology for autonomous tracked vehicles navigating in a rough and unknown environment. Two fields of study are dealt with in this paper: motion planning and slip estimation. For the motion planner, the CC-RRT? algorithm is combined with LQG-MP. The motion planner uses a chance-constrained approach and considers the role of compensator in the planning step to provide a robust yet non-conservative planner. For the slip estimator, a stable yet practical online approach known as IPEM is used. IPEM compares the integrated prediction with the measurement to calculate appropriate parameters. The methodology performs online slip estimation and re-planning iteratively. This guarantees the safe travel of the vehicle even when there is an unexpected terrain change that can be fatal. The simulation result shows that the iterative estimation and re-planning plays a significant role in ensuring the safety of the vehicle. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[1922\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a search-based global motion planning method, called the two-phase A*, with an adaptive heuristic weight. This method is suitable for planning a global path in real time for a car-like vehicle in both indoor and outdoor environments. In each planning cycle, the method first estimates a proper heuristic weight based on the hardness of the planning query. Then, it finds a nearly optimal path subject to the non-holonomic constraints using an improved A* with a weighted heuristic function. By estimating the heuristic weight dynamically, the two-phase A* is able to adjust the optimality level of its path based on the hardness of the planning query. Therefore, the two-phase A* sacrifices little planning optimality, and its computation time is acceptable in most situations. The two-phase A* has been implemented and tested in the simulations and real-world experiments over various task environments. The results show that the two-phase A* can generate a nearly optimal global path dynamically, which satisfies the non-holonomic constraints of a car-like vehicle and reduces the total navigation time. © IMechE 2020.\"],\n",

    "[1935\t,0,0,\"This paper presents a traversability assessment method and a trajectory planning method. They are key features for the navigation of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in a non-planar environment. In this work, a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is used to obtain the geometric information about a rough terrain surface. For a given SE(2) pose of the vehicle and a specific vehicle model, the SE(3) pose of the vehicle is estimated based on LiDAR points, and then a traversability is computed. The traversability tells the vehicle the effects of its interaction with the rough terrain. Note that the traversability is computed on demand during trajectory planning, so there is not any explicit terrain discretization. The proposed trajectory planner finds an initial path through the non-holonomic A*, which is a modified form of the conventional A* planner. A path is a sequence of poses without timestamps. Then, the initial path is optimized in terms of the traversability, using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The optimization accounts for the model of the vehicle’s suspension system. Therefore, the optimized trajectory is dynamically feasible, and the trajectory tracking error is small. The proposed methods were tested in both the simulation and the real-world experiments. The simulation experiments were conducted in a simulator called Gazebo, which uses a physics engine to compute the vehicle motion. The experiments were conducted in various non-planar experiments. The results indicate that the proposed methods could accurately estimate the SE(3) pose of the vehicle.

These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs.

    "[1949\t,0,0,\"This paper presents an approach that integrates the geometric notion of clearance (distance to the closest obstacle) into sampling-based motion planning to enable a robot to safely navigate in challenging environments. To reach the goal destination, the robot must obey geometric and differential constraints that arise from the underlying motion dynamics and the characteristics of the environment. To produce safe paths, the proposed approach expands a motion tree of collision-free and dynamically feasible motions while maintaining locally maximal clearance. In distinction from related work, rather than explicitly constructing the medial axis, the proposed approach imposes a grid or a triangular tessellation over the free space and uses the clearance information to construct a weighted graph where edges that connect regions with low clearance have high cost. Minimum-cost paths over this graph produce high-clearance routes that tend to follow the medial axis without requiring its explicit construction. A key aspect of the proposed approach is a route-following component which efficiently expands the motion tree to closely follow such high-clearance routes. When expansion along the current route becomes difficult, edges in the tessellation are penalized in order to promote motion-tree expansions along alternative high-clearance routes to the goal.

    "[1959\t,0,0,\"This paper presents an effective, cooperative, and probabilistically-complete multirobot motion planner that enables each robot to move to a desired location while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other robots. The approach takes into account not only the geometric constraints arising from collision avoidance, but also the differential constraints imposed by the motion dynamics of each robot. This makes it possible to generate collisionfree and dynamically-feasible trajectories that can be executed in the physical world. The salient aspect of the approach is the coupling of sampling-based motion planning to handle the complexity arising from the obstacles and robot dynamics with multi-agent search to find solutions over a suitable discrete abstraction. The discrete abstraction is obtained by constructing roadmaps to solve a relaxed problem that accounts for the obstacles but not the dynamics. Sampling-based motion planning expands a motion tree in the composite state space of all the robots by adding collision-free and dynamicallyfeasible trajectories as branches. Effciency is obtained by using multi-agent search to find non-conicting routes over the discrete abstraction which serve as heuristics to guide the motion-tree expansion. When little or no progress is made, the routes are penalized and the multi-agent search is invoked again to find alternative routes. This synergistic coupling makes it possible to effectively plan collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions that enable each robot to reach its goal.

And in the improved algorithm, the nonuniform distribution of the initial pheromone and the selection strategy with direction play a very positive role in the path search. The coverage and updating strategy of pheromone is introduced to avoid repeated search reducing the effect of the number of ants on the performance of the algorithm. In addition, the pheromone evaporation coefficient is segmented and adjusted, which can effectively balance the convergence speed and search ability. Finally, this paper provides a theoretical basis for the improved ant colony algorithm by strict mathematical derivation, and some numerical simulations are also given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. © 2016 Jiang Zhao et al.\"],\n",

Artificial potential field method has been widely applied to indoor robot collision-avoidance-path planning. However, it's not much used for outdoor scene. Whether perception model or environment model, the outdoor intelligent vehicle collision-avoidance is much more complex than indoor robot. Therefore, we have improved the method: Firstly, we have improved the perception model of the method. To simulate real-world scene, the intelligent vehicle sensing range is limited to 150° fan-shaped area. Secondly, We have improved the potential function components, that is, adding the road constraints. The intelligent vehicle not only need to achieve collision-avoidance, but also can't exceed the road boundary. Meanwhile, we effectively solve the most common problem of local minima. The simulation results show: the improved algorithm can accomplish the intelligent vehicle collision-avoidance-path planning well in a realistic simulation scene. ©, 2015, Binary Information Press.

This method aims to reduce the need for control calibration by properly considering plant uncertainties and tire force limits at the design stage.

The available tire force is distributed to the feedforward part, which is used to generate the nominal trajectory in trajectory planning phase, and to the feedback part, which is used for trajectory tracking. The trajectory planning problem is solved not by searching through a continuous spectrum of steering/braking actions, but by examining a limited set of 'motion primitives,' or motion templates that can be adopted in sequence to avoid the pedestrian. An emergency rapid random tree (RRT) methodology is proposed to quickly identify a feasible solution.

In total, 3,828 trajectories of human-driven vehicles around the AV are accumulated in a global coordinate system. After postprocessing the collected trajectories, 83,188 and 35,652 data samples were used to train and validate the Bi-LSTM module, respectively. In the Bi-LSTM module, a maneuver is defined as the desired driving lane of a vehicle, which extend the behavior coverage of the proposed approach. The trajectory prediction step is based on the path-following model with a motion parameter estimator to predict the trajectories for all possible maneuvers. The interaction module considers the likelihood of each maneuver and the collision risk to determine the future trajectories of the surrounding vehicles in terms of the driving scene.

The optimum velocity profile is sought for a predefined road path from a specific starting point to a final one within specific and given boundaries and constrains in order to minimise the motion sickness without compromising the journey time. For the representation of the motion sickness as a cost function to our optimal control problem, the illness rating is used. The influence of road width flexibility on illness rating and for a set of fixed journey times are investigated. According to the results, the road with flexible lateral manoeuvrability is found to provide lower sickness compared to the fixed road path.

In particular, the goal consists in finding the best routing plan for the UAVs in order to visit some designated targets in a wide search area to augment the UGVs’ situational awareness. Taking into account the maximal endurance constraint of the UAVs, this problem becomes equivalent to a time-constrained multiple depot vehicle routing problem with moving depots. To tackle this variant of the well-known vehicle routing problem, a methodology based on a TABU search meta-heuristic is implemented. While respecting the endurance constraint, this methodology tempts to optimize multiple objectives: the number of UAVs required, the total length of the routing and the balance of the lengths of the different routes within the routing plan.

Overdriven factor in a vehicle motion especially on a cornering track, is one of the issues that need to be tackled for safety and energy efficiency. Hence, in the attempt to cope with the issue, this study proposes to implement a dynamic control technique that considers the interaction between the vehicle and its terrain by using indirectly shaping inertia forces. The proposed force-based impedance control is derived by considering the forces developed by the rack steering vehicle and shaping the vehicle velocities as its kinodynamic inputs. The implementation of the proposed dynamic control, emphasis is given to the vertical and horizontal axes of the vehicle body, during which inertia could happen as its velocity is at its lowest. This proposed dynamic control strategy is verified by simulating on the steering system model with road terrain and aerodynamic frictions as disturbances.

Two optimization models, integrated and decomposed, are developed and solved for path planning and design optimization of UAVs. Both models minimize a weighted sum of risk and time. The risk is based on a simulation of a UAV’s crash after it loses power and is estimated by computing an expected number of on-the-ground human population fatalities which are located at or near the UAV crash site. The flight time is computed for the UAV as it travels from a start to an end point. The integrated model solves the design and path planning optimization problem all-at-once. The decomposed model has two subproblems: one for the design optimization of UAV and another for its path planning optimization. A new decomposed method for solving the path planning subproblem while considering the design optimization subproblem is presented, which solves the path planning subproblem for a discrete graph. Results for this new method are compared to an integrated all-at-once approach that does not treat the design and path planning subproblems separately, which can indicate the method proposed is less vulnerable to local minima in the path planning optimization subproblem. © 2015 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Generally, in a shared infrastructure where several agents aim to use limited capacity resources, finding a set of optimal and conflict-free paths for each single agent is the most critical part. In such a dynamic environment where continual planning and scheduling are required, we have adopted a coupled (centralized) technique and face the problem by breaking it into two distinct phases: path planning and collision avoidance. In the first phase, the lowest cost path is planned for each agent by a modified version of Dijkstra algorithm. Following that, in the second phase, the head-on collisions can be foreseen and avoided by detecting the agents' common segments of the path choices.

Due to the complexity of dynamically changing structured environment, the path planner generally requires to generate a safe and smooth path in a short time when changing lanes. Therefore, we propose an efficient lane change path planning method, which can take into account both the curvature and heading angle of the planned path, ensuring the safety and stability of the lane change maneuver. It builds upon existing method using quintic spline with second-order geometric (G2-) continuity in a Frenet coordinate system. By calculating the optimal prediction time interval of the lane change maneuver, the heading angle was kept within a safe range. In order to improve the real-time performance, we use road prior information to optimize the selection of sampling points, effectively reducing the number of candidate paths. In addition, beyond the sampling points, the problem of continuous lane change is solved by adding mid-adjust point and target point, so that AVs have the ability to complete complex movements. In an urban environment, the proposed method is tested on our experimental autonomous vehicle equipped with a modular ROS architecture.

The Implementation area is a subset of the Observation area, whereas the Explored area is the union of all the previous Observation areas. The path is planned with a receding horizon planning strategy to generate waypoints and in-between map updates. When a new map update occurs, the path is replanned within the current Observation area if necessary. If no such path exists, the search is extended to the Explored area. Paths can be planned by recursively searching available nodes inside the Explored area that can be connected to available nodes on the boundary of the Explored area.

    "[2029\t,0,0,\"This paper proposes a risk-aware path planning method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, with the aim to generate safe flight paths minimizing the risk to the population. The proposed approach consists of two phases: first, an off-line path planning computes the optimal global path in a static environment considering the risk; then, taking into account a dynamic risk-map, an on-line path planning adjusts and adapts the off-line path. The risk-map is a location-based map, in which each cell represents a specific location with an associated risk-cost.The off-line path planning is performed by the riskA? algorithm. It is based on the well-known A? algorithm, enhanced considering the minimization of the risk-cost. The off-line path planning is executed in a static environment and it has no time constraints. On the contrary, the on-line path planning needs to adapt the path in a short time, thus a fast response constitutes a critical design parameter. The on-line path planning is performed by a novel algorithm, called Borderland. Borderland uses a check and repair routine, then it identifies and adjusts only the portions of path involved by changes in the dynamic risk-map.

Step 1 uses the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the 3D Euclidean distances as the fitness function to assign multiple tasks to multiple AUVs; Step 2 designs the 2D Dubins paths for each AUV target sequence; and Step 3 maps the 2D Dubins paths to 3D paths via cubic spline interpolaten. Finally, potential collision is detected among the resulting paths of the multiple AUVs and paths are discarded if any AUV is within the close vincinity of another AUV at any time.

The experiments on large scale simulated traffic data show the scheduling algorithm scales linearly with the number of traffic flows and vehicles.

In a complex mission environment, the characteristics of vehicles can be heterogeneous in the sense that they can differ in the sensing range or the motion constraints. The main purpose of path planning in this study was to find a set of paths that minimizes the sum of costs for each UAV while visiting every task region at least once.

    "[2034\t,1,1,\"This paper proposes a two-dimensional car-following model to tackle traffic flow problems where considering continuum lateral distances enables a simpler or more natural mathematical formulation compared to traditional car-following models. These problems include (i) the effects of lateral friction often observed in HOV lanes and diverge bottlenecks, (ii) the relaxation phenomenon at merge bottlenecks, (iii) the occurrence of accidents due to lane changing, and (iv) traffic models for autonomous vehicles (AVs). We conjecture that traditional car-following models, where the lateral dimension is discretized into lanes, struggle with these problems and one has to resort to ad-hoc rules conceived to directly achieve the desired effect, and that are difficult to validate. We argue that the distance maintained by drivers in order to avoid collisions in all directions plays a fundamental role in all these problems. To test this hypothesis, we propose a simple two-dimensional microscopic car-following model based on the social force paradigm, and build simulation experiments that reproduce these phenomena. These phenomena are reproduced as an indirect consequence of the model's formulation, as opposed to ad-hoc rules, thus shedding light on their causes. A better understanding of the behavior of human drivers in the lateral dimension can be translated to improving autonomous driving algorithms so that they are human-friendly. In addition, since AV technology is proprietary, we argue that the proposed model should provide a good starting point for building AV traffic flow models when real data becomes available, as these data come from sensors that cover two-dimensional regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"],\n",

    "[2037\t,0,0,\"This paper proposes an integrated motion planning and control approach for autonomous car navigation. Existing approaches to autonomous vehicle navigation typically plan a trajectory and pass it on to a steering controller that commands steering wheel angle (SWA) or curvature at every timestep to minimize tracking error. However, this approach exhibits large amounts of control effort, and ignores other criteria such as smoothness or the importance of staying on plan at different times. Conversely, our proposed approach leverages the concept of potential fields to represent a driving corridor with a desired tracking error tolerance and direct torque-based steering control to smoothly steer the vehicle with a much smaller control effort. Further, using potential fields allows us to naturally incorporate obstacles in the driving corridor to circumvent them, with typically no need for explicit trajectory planning. We compare our approach to a standard steering controller in experiments with a real-world autonomous vehicle platform. Results show that our proposed approach achieves similar path tracking performance as a high-gain SWA controller, but with much less actuator effort. © 2015 IEEE.\"],\n",

INTERACT is geared towards scenarios involving a mobile robot operating in a fully known environment consisting of static and movable objects. INTERACT makes it possible to specify a task in the planning domain definition language (PDDL) and automatically computes a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory that enables the robot to accomplish the task. The coupling of sampling-based motion planning with action planning is made possible by expanding a tree of feasible motions and partitioning it into equivalence classes based on the task predicates. Action plans provide guidance as to which a equivalence class should be further expanded. Information gathered during the motion tree expansion is used to adjust the action costs in order to effectively guide the expansion towards the goal. This interactive process of selecting an equivalence class, expanding the motion tree to implement its action plan and updating the action costs and plans to reflect the progress made is repeated until a solution is found.

First, a vehicle kinematic model with road coordinates is established to describe the lateral movement of the vehicle. Then, nonlinear optimization based on a vehicle kinematic model in the space domain is employed to smooth the reference road. Second, a multilayered search algorithm is applied in the lateral-space domain to deal with obstacles and find a suitable path boundary. Then, the optimized path planner calculates the optimal path by con-sidering the distance to the reference road and the curvature constraints. Furthermore, the optimized speed planner takes into account the speed boundary in the space domain and the constraints on vehicle acceleration. The optimal speed profile is obtained by using a numerical optimization method. Furthermore, a motion controller based on a kinematic error model is proposed to follow the desired trajectory.

    "[2042\t,1,1,\"This paper proposes and evaluates an algorithm called Multi-Objective planning based on Simulated Annealing (MOSA) that plans a trajectory (speed profile) for a passenger car on a free, single lane road. This algorithm is relying on a decomposition of the decision space into chunks that are optimized separately. Two objectives have been taken into account: travel time and fuel consumption. Optimization constraints are built from safety modelings combining legal speed, curves speed limits and junctions limits. The multi-objective optimization is performed through a linear scalairisation method and the optimization is a parametric optimization based on simulated annealing. The algorithm has been tested on simulated annealing convergence and results show a good convergence under 500 iterations and a small sensitivity to variables initialization. However, sensitivity to core parameters of the simulated annealing (initial temperature and temperature decreasing rate) is very high and some guidelines for the calibration of these parameters are given in this paper. Then, the algorithm has been tested and compared to experimental results and it shows that, even if some drivers can drive the road quicker than the algorithm, they cannot drive with a lower fuel consumption. Furthermore, the algorithm results are better than the most of the experimental results according to the Pareto definition of dominance and global results outperform results from another planning algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm. Future works will concentrate on improving the algorithm to be more reactive to unexpected obstacles and more consistant in the chunks transitions. © 2019 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.\"],\n",
    "[2043\t,0,0,\"This paper proposes new motion primitives that are time optimal and feasible for a vehicle (wheeled-mobile robot). They are parameterized by a constant acceleration and a constant deceleration in an obstacle-free environment between an initial and a final configuration with given poses and velocities. The derived compact parametric solution has an implicit optimal velocity profile, is continuous in C2, considers driving constraints, and is computationally efficient. The path is derived analytically considering constraints on maximal allowable driving velocity and accelerations. The obtained motion primitives have continuous transition of curvature and are, thus, easily drivable by the vehicle. The proposed motion primitives are evaluated on several path-planning examples, and the obtained solutions are compared to a numerically expensive planner using Bernstein-Bézier curve with path shape and velocity profile optimization. Numerous experiments have been conducted not only in the simulation environment, but also during testing and comparisons on the actual mobile robot platforms. It is shown that the proposed solution is computationally efficient, time optimal under given constraints and trapezoidal velocity profile assumptions, and is close to globally optimal solution with an arbitrary velocity profile. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

The proposed approach takes as input a mission specified via a regular language and automatically plans a collision-free, dynamically feasible, and low-cost trajectory which enables the vehicle to accomplish the mission. Regular languages provide a convenientmathematicalmodel that frees users from the burden of unnatural low-level commands and instead allows them to describe missions at a high level in terms of desired objectives. To account for the constraints imposed by the mission, vehicle dynamics, collision avoidance, and the complex spatial and temporal variability of the ocean environment, the approach tightly couples mission planning with sampling-based motion planning. A key aspect is a discrete abstraction obtained by combining the finite automaton representing the regular language with a navigation roadmap constructed by probabilistic sampling. The approach searches the discrete abstraction to compute low-cost and collision-free navigation routes that are compatible with the mission. Sampling-based motion planning is then used to expand a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories along the navigation routes. The approach is validated both in simulation and field experiments.

We characterize Nash equilibria of the edge-game and provide closed form expressions for the case of two actions per player. We further provide an analytic and approximate expression on the value of an edge-game and characterize conditions under which it grows sub-linearly with the length of the edge. We study the sensitivity of Nash equilibrium to the (i) cost of using the countermeasure, (ii) cost of motion and (iii) benefit of disabling the attack.

The vehicles have different capabilities, and each kind of vehicles needs to visit a certain type of target locations; each target location might have the demand to be visited more than once by different kinds of vehicles. To find approximate solutions for such a challenging problem, we first design a path planning algorithm to minimize the time for a single vehicle to travel between two given locations through the drift field while avoiding obstacles. The path planning algorithm provides the travel cost matrix for the target assignment, and generates routes once the target locations are assigned to the vehicles. Then, we propose an auction-based distributed task assignment algorithm to assign the target locations to the vehicles using only local communication. Finally, numerical simulations show that the algorithm can lead to solutions close to the optimal. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[2066\t,0,0,\"This paper studies the problem of autonomous data collection where an underwater vehicle is required to reach several target regions within a specified time limit. The proposed approach takes into account the vehicle dynamics, the time-varying ocean currents, and the obstacles in the region in order to effectively plan a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory whose time duration does not exceed the time limit. When the time limit makes it impossible to reach every target, the approach seeks to reduce the penalty accrued by the target regions that are not visited. The approach combines sampling-based motion planning with constraint-based solvers. In fact, a constraint-based solver searches a navigation roadmap to compute bounded tours which minimize the accrued penalty. Sampling-based motion planning is then used to expand a motion tree along these tours. Unsuccessful tour expansions are penalized to promote exploration of alternative tours. Simulation and field experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in planning collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories that reduce the accrued penalty. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

Particular attention is devoted to goals that become feasible only if a subset of the safety rules are violated. The proposed algorithm computes a control law, that minimizes the level of unsafety while the desired goal is guaranteed to be reached. This problem is motivated by an autonomous car navigating an urban environment while following rules of the road such as always travel in right lane and do not change lanes frequently. Ideas behind sampling based motionplanning algorithms, such as Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), are employed to incrementally construct a finite concretization of the dynamics as a durational Kripke structure. In conjunction with this, a weighted finite automaton that captures the safety rules is used in order to find an optimal trajectory that minimizes the violation of safety rules.

In addition, when planning the optimized flying routes for collecting images on a debris fan, the specifications of the debris fan and the limitations of the UAV should both be taken into consideration. The path planning method takes a debris fan as an example and refers to the specifications of a debris fan and the limitations of the UAV. The developed method can help the operators to ensure the image overlap through dividing the debris fan into cells by the UAV's maximum image collection distance interval. The near-optimized UAV flying paths are calculated though applying a modified ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO).

The proposed method searches for a desirable Pareto-optimal solution using an “aspiration point” and an “ideal point.” The aspiration point refers to the preference information for a decision maker (DM), and the ideal point represents a virtual solution that optimizes all objective functions simultaneously. All of the solutions generated in using evolutionary computation evolve toward the aspiration region, which is determined by the aspiration point. If a solution that is closer to the ideal point than the aspiration point is generated in the search process, the aspiration point is moved to the position of the solution point. This process is repeated until specific termination conditions are satisfied. Some results of the benchmark test problems show that the proposed method can efficiently generate the Pareto-optimal solution for the DM and a high probability compared to the existing method called the “weighted-sum method.” The usefulness of the proposed method is also shown by applying it to a multi-objective path planning problem that assumes an aerial photo-shoot mission using a UAV. © 2017 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.\"],\n",

    "[2077\t,0,0,\"This research presents two novel approaches to nonholonomic motion planning. The methodologies presented are based on the standard fast marching square path planning method and its application to car-like robots. Under the first method, the environment is considered as a three-dimensional C-space, with the first two dimensions given by the position of the robot and the third dimension by its orientation. This means that we operate over the configuration space instead of the bi-dimensional environment map. Moreover, the trajectory is computed along the C-space taking into account the dimensions of the vehicle, and thus guaranteeing the absence of collisions. The second method uses the standard fast marching square, and takes advantage of the vector field of the velocities computed during the first step of the method in order to adapt the motion plan to the control inputs that a car-like robot is able to execute.

We develop and subsequently employ a deterministic simulation model of the kinematics of automated cars at a signalized intersection approach, when proceeding forward from a stationary queue at the beginning of a signal phase. In the discrete-time simulation, each vehicle pursues an operational strategy that is consistent with the 'Assured Clear Distance Ahead' criterion: each vehicle limits its speed and spacing from the vehicle ahead of it by its objective of not striking it, regardless of whether or not the future behavior of the vehicle ahead is cooperative. The simulation incorporates a set of assumptions regarding the values of operational parameters that will govern automated cars' kinematics in the immediate future, which are sourced from the relevant literature.We report several findings of note. First, under a set of assumed 'central' (i.e. most plausible) parameter values, the time requirement to process a standing queue of ten vehicles is decreased by 25% relative to human driven vehicles. Second, it was found that the standard queue discharge model for human-driven cars does not directly transfer to queue discharge of automated vehicles. Third, a wet roadway surface may result in an increase in capacity at signalized intersections. Fourth, a specific form of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications that allows all automated vehicles in the stationary queue to begin moving simultaneously at the beginning of a signal phase provides relatively minor increases in capacity in this analysis. Fifth, in recognition of uncertainty regarding the value of each operational parameter, we identify (via scenario analysis, calculation of arc elasticities, and Monte-Carlo methods) the relative sensitivity of overall traffic flow efficiency to the value of each operational parameter.This study comprises an incremental step towards the broader objective of adapting standard techniques for analyzing traffic operations to account for the capabilities of automated vehicles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

The simulator used features eight DOF and is able to reproduce the maneuvers realistically, which is necessary to reduce the probability of cross couplings with simulator sickness. There were two scenarios: driving on a winding country road and highway driving with frequent lane changes. MS severity was measured subjectively via questionnaire and objectively via heartrate. In addition temperature data was collected. Even though MS symptoms have been evoked, no significant effects were found in case of suspension settings for MS in general. For single symptoms nausea and vertigo, slight significances were detected between the roll compensated car and the other variants. High lateral acceleration led to significantly higher motion sickness ratings for all suspension variants and should be avoided in trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles. In conclusion there is no benefit by the use of active roll stabilization and rear wheel steering systems in case of motion sickness, when driving in similar driving conditions as in this study.

We analyze noncooperative (defensive) behavior, in keeping with the Assured Clear Distance Ahead legal standard to which human drivers are held and AVs will likely also be for the foreseeable future. We demonstrate that, under plausible behavioral parameters, AVs appear likely to have positive impacts on throughput of turning traffic streams at intersections, in the range of +0.2% (under the most conservative circumstances) to +43% for a typical turning maneuver.

To recognize in advance a potential collision situation between the vehicle and an approaching object, a quantitative collision risk degree and a collision risk zone must be evaluated and predicted. However, they are difficult to accurately evaluate and predict, since the motion information of the vehicle and object includes various uncertainties caused by navigation sensors and environmental disturbances. Hence, the collision risk, which is expressed as a collision probability, is evaluated based on the probabilistic method considering the time-varying trajectory uncertainties of the vehicle and object. In addition, the collision risk zone on the predicted trajectory of the vehicle is determined considering the uncertainties and safe separation zones with respect to the vehicle and object.

A traditional view-planning approach for SfM is extended to a multi-scale approach, planning for targeted regions of high, medium, and low priority. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can traverse the entire aerial space and facilitates collection of an optimized set of views, both close to and far away from areas of interest. The test case for field validation is the Tibble Fork Dam in Utah. Using the targeted multi-scale flight planning, a UAV automatically flies a tiered inspection using less than 25% of the number of photos needed to model the entire dam at high-priority level. This results in approximately 75% reduced flight time and model processing load, while still maintaining high model accuracy where needed. Models display stepped improvement in visual clarity and SfM reconstruction integrity by priority level, with the higher priority regions more accurately modeling smaller and finer features. A resolution map of the final tiered model is included.

By optimizing the potential field function in the framework of optimal control theory, the desired yaw rate and the desired longitudinal deceleration are theoretically calculated. Finally, the validity of the proposed motion planning and control system is verified by comparing the simulation results with the actual driving data by experienced drivers. © 2016 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.

An optimized path is planned for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to save energy during the diving process. The key idea is to apply success-history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) to the optimization of energy. In addition, motion constraints are considered during the diving process to ensure that the path points are reachable. We take the sequence of motion angles as the population, and propose an angle modification strategy to apply to the population evolution process, so that the angle sequence remains in the space of feasible solutions. The modification strategy lays a theoretical foundation for the application of L-SHADE in this path planning problem. The performance of PPM-BBD is evaluated on data from simulation test. The most suitable control parameters are determined through simulation experiments. The effects of PPM-BBD with L-SHADE and five types of DE are compared. The experimental evaluation was performed through sea trials in Tuandao Bay, Qingdao, China. Results show that PPM-BBD saves at least 9% energy compared to the other algorithms.

    "[2100\t,1,1,\"This work addresses the formation phase of automatic platooning. The objective is to optimally control the throttle of vehicles, with a given arbitrary initial condition, such that desired ground speed and inter-vehicular spacings are reached. The steering of the vehicles is also controlled, because the vehicles should track a desired path while forming the platoon. In order to address the platoon formation problem, a cooperative strategy is formed by constructing a discrete state space model which represents the dynamics of a set of n vehicles. Once this model is set, a control method known as Interpolating Control, which aims at regulating to the origin an uncertain and/or time-varying linear discrete-time system with state and control constraints, is utilized. The performance of this control method is evaluated and compared with other approaches such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Simulations are conducted which suggest that the Interpolating Control approach can be seen as an alternative to optimization-based control schemes such as Model Predictive Control, especially for problems for which finding the optimal solution requires calculations, where the Interpolating Control approach can provide a straightforward sub-optimal solution.

    "[2106\t,1,1,\"This work introduces a surrogate modeling strategy, based on diffusion maps manifold learning and artificial neural networks. On this basis, a numerical procedure is developed for cost-efficient predictions of a complex system's response modeled by parametrized partial differential equations. The idea is to utilize a collection of solution snapshots, obtained by solving the partial differential equation for a small number of parameter values, in order to establish an efficient yet accurate mapping from the problem's parametric space to its solution space. In common practice, solving the partial differential equations in the framework of the finite element method leads to high-dimensional data sets, which are a major challenge for machine learning algorithms to handle (curse of dimensionality). To overcome this problem, the proposed method exploits the dimensionality reduction properties of the diffusion maps algorithm in order to obtain a meaningful low-dimensional representation of the solution data set. With this approach, a reduced set of ‘hyperparameters’ is obtained, namely, the diffusion map coordinates, that characterize the high-dimensional solution vectors. Using this reduced representation, a feed-forward neural network is efficiently trained that maps the problem's parameter values to their images in the low-dimensional diffusion maps space. This approach offers two advantages. The obvious one is that it reduces the computational resources and CPU time needed to train the neural network, which can be prohibitive for high dimensional problems. The second advantage is that training the neural network on the diffusion map coordinates, essentially translates to using the diffusion maps distance in the MSE loss function of the network. Compared to the Euclidean distance in the ambient space, the diffusion distance gives a better approximation of the distance between two points on the solution manifold, which leads to a more accurate network. Lastly, a mapping is developed based on the Laplacian pyramids scheme in order to convert points from the diffusion maps space back to the solution space. The composition of the neural network with the Laplacian pyramid scheme, substitutes the process of solving the partial differential equation under consideration, and is capable of providing the additional system solutions at a very low cost and high accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

Adaptation of the proposed path planning method depends on the constraints of the total transition times, transient lateral acceleration, and associated jerk; thus, the mathematical relationship among the key variables above was calculated and their influence on the path planning was analyzed by drawing a virtual desired trajectory under different traffic scenarios. Next, a linear discrete-time vehicle dynamic model was presented and constraints on the control inputs, state values, and road parameters, used to ensure the tracking performance and vehicle stability, were encoded into the cost function; a model predictive controller with multi-constraints (MMPC) was then developed to track the desired trajectory for lane changing, and Hildreth's quadratic programming procedure was adopted to compute the front steering angle of the vehicle for path tracking during the lane-changing process. Finally, the proposed MMPC and a model predictive controller with a single constraint (SMPC) were developed using MATLAB and Carsim software, and both controllers for a path tracking task were implemented and compared in co-simulations under total transition times of 3 s and 6 s. When the total transition time was 6 s, both MMPC and SMPC were able to provide a satisfactory tracking performance for a lane change; in addition, compared with SMPC, the proposed MMPC was capable of providing satisfactory tracking performance and improving the maneuverability on a low-friction coefficient road when the total transition time was 3 s, which motivated the effort to improve the active safety of intelligent vehicles during the path tracking process. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

    "[2129\t,0,0,\"To air-refuel multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by a refueling vehicle, we propose a 3-dimensional optimal rendezvous-path planning strategy for the refueling vehicle. Since UAVs are distributed in space, the refueling vehicle has to fly along a pre-planned flight path to rendezvous with the UAV for executing the refueling. Because only a limited number of UAV may be refueled simultaneously by a refueling vehicle, an optimal allocation strategy has to be found for assigning the proper refueling area and the proper time to each UAV for rendezvous. This allocation problem is formulated as an integer linear programming problem according to the shortest rendezvous time required by each UAV in its refueling area. By solving this problem, we obtain the optimal rendezvous point of refueling for each UAV. Next, we employ the 3D Dubins elongation algorithm to ensure every UAV to rendezvous with the fueling vehicle at the assigned allocation point.

A* algorithm is a classical trajectory planning algorithm that has good results in the field of robot path planning. However, there are still some practical problems to be solved when the algorithm is applied to vehicles, such as the algorithm fails to consider the vehicle contours, the planned path is not smooth, and it lacks speed planning. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a path processing method and a path tracking method for the A* algorithm. First, the method of configuring safe redundancy space is given considering the vehicle contour, then, the path is generated based on A* algorithm and smoothed using Bessel curve, and the speed is planned based on the curvature of the path. The trajectory tracking algorithm in this paper is based on an expert system and pure tracking theory. In terms of speed tracking, an expert system for the acceleration characteristics of the vehicle is constructed and used as a priori information for speed control, and good results are obtained. In terms of path tracking, the required steering wheel angle is calculated based on pure tracking theory, and the influence factor of speed on steering is obtained from test data, based on which the steering wheel angle is corrected and the accuracy of path tracking is improved. In addition, this paper proposes a target point selection method for the pure tracking algorithm to improve the stability of vehicle directional control. Finally, a simulation analysis of the proposed method is performed.

A good balance between solution quality and computational tractability can then be achieved. Nonconvex optimal control model for multi-UAV trajectory planning is formulated first, and is then approximated to be a convex optimization by discretization and convexification methods. To convexify the nonconvex model, equations of motion of UAVs are linearized, and constraints of threat avoidance and inter-UAVs collision avoidance are convexified. Meanwhile, an inter-sample threat avoidance method is provided to guarantee UAVs' safety at intervals between discrete trajectory points. Based on convex optimization formulation, the detailed procedure of using sequential convex programming based on penalty function to solve multi-UAV trajectory planning is provided.

Because the performance of the autonomous navigation can be degraded by the uncertainties, the AGV requires a robust control system against them. To handle the necessity, this study proposes the robust path controller by utilizing a disturbance observer (DOB)-based control method. The proposed controller is developed by two steps: the first step is to design a controller for handling a nominal system of the AGV, and the other is to add the DOB to the nominal controller. Then, the determined control input is distributed into tire forces because the tire forces are final resource enabling the AGV to move. The tire force distribution is defined as an optimization problem with some constraints, and the solution is obtained by the CVXGEN.

    "[2195\t,0,0,\"Uncertain dynamic obstacles, such as pedestrians or vehicles, pose a major challenge for optimal robot navigation with safety guarantees. Previous work on optimal motion planning has employed two main strategies to define a safe bound on an obstacle's space: using a polyhedron or a nonlinear differentiable surface. The former approach relies on disjunctive programming, which has a relatively high computational cost that grows exponentially with the number of obstacles. The latter approach needs to be linearized locally to find a tractable evaluation of the chance constraints, which dramatically reduces the remaining free space and leads to over-conservative trajectories or even unfeasibility. In this work, we present a hybrid approach that eludes the pitfalls of both strategies while maintaining the original safety guarantees. The key idea consists in obtaining a safe differentiable approximation for the disjunctive chance constraints bounding the obstacles. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem can be efficiently solved to meet fast real-time requirements with multiple obstacles.

    "[2196\t,1,1,\"Understanding the dynamic characteristics of surrounding vehicles and estimating the potential risk of mixed traffic can help reliable autonomous driving. However, the existing risk assessment methods are challenging to detect dangerous situations in advance and tackle the uncertainty of mixed traffic. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic driving risk assessment framework based on intention identification and risk assessment of surrounding vehicles. Firstly, we set up an intention identification model (IIM) via long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify the intention possibility of the surrounding vehicles. Then a risk assessment model (RAM) based on the driving safety field is employed to output the potential risk. Specifically, driving safety field can reflect the coupling relationship of drivers, vehicles, and roads by analyzing their interaction. Finally, an integrated risk evaluation model combining both IIM and RAM is developed to form a dynamic potential risk map considering multi-vehicle interaction. For example, in a typical but challenging lane-changing scenario, an intelligent vehicle can assess its driving status by calculating a risk map in real time that represents the risk generated by the estimated intentions of surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, simulations and naturalistic driving experiments are conducted in the extracted lane-changing scenarios, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model considering lane-changing behavior interaction. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"],\n",

These vehicles are conceived as multi-sensor platforms, and can be used to collect ocean data for long periods in wide range areas. This endurance is achieved at the cost of low speed, which requires extensive planning to ensure vehicle safety and mission success, particularly when dealing with strong ocean currents. As gliders are often involved on missions that pursue multiple objectives (track events, reach a target point, avoid obstacles, sample specified areas, save energy), path planning requires a way to deal with several constraints at the same time; this makes glider path planning a multi-objective (MO) optimization problem. In this work, we analyse the usage of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to tackle a MO glider path planning application on a complex environment integrating 3D and time varying ocean currents. Multiple experiments using a glider kinematic simulator coupled with NSGA-II, combining different control parameters were carried out, to find the best parameter configuration that provided suitable paths for the desired mission. Ultimately, the system described in this work was able to optimize multi-objective trajectories, providing non dominated solutions.

In this paper an efficient motion planning framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented. By introducing a loosely coupled multilayered planning design, our framework is able to generate dynamically feasible trajectories while keeping the planning time low enough for online planning. First, a fast path planner operating in a lower-dimensional projected space computes a lead path from the start to the goal configuration. Then, the lead path is used to bias the sampling of a second motion planner, which takes into account all the dynamic constraints. Furthermore, we propose a strategy for online planning that saves computational resources by generating the final trajectory only up to a finite horizon. By using the finite horizon strategy together with the multilayered approach, the sampling of the second planner focuses on regions where good quality solutions are more likely to be found, significantly reducing the planning time. To provide strong safety guarantees our framework also incorporates the conservative approximations of inevitable collision states (icss). finally, we present simulations and experiments using a real underwater robot to demonstrate the capabilities of our framework. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[2249\t,0,0,\"Urban environments are becoming more and more complex because several factors as consecutive crossroads or lanes changes. These scenarios demand specific infrastructures—i.e. roundabouts, for improving traffic flow compared with traditional intersections. A roundabout removes timeouts associated with traffic lights at crossroads and trajectory conflicts among drivers. However, it is a challenging scenario for both humans and automated vehicles. This work presents a path planning method for automated vehicle driving at roundabouts. The proposed system achieves a G1 continuous path, minimizing curvature steps to increase smoothness, dividing the driving process in three stages: entrance maneuver, driving within the roundabout and exit maneuver. Parametric equations are generated to deal with automated roundabout driving. This approach allows a real time planning considering two-lane roundabouts, taking different exits.

Fortunately, the Bezier Curve is defined by the states of the starting point and the target point. We can use this feature to make the vehicle in the expected direction. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to combine the Bezier Curve with the VFH algorithm, to search for the collision-free states with the VFH search method, and to select the optimal trajectory point with the Bezier Curve as the reference line. This means that we will improve the cost function in the VFH algorithm by comparing the distance between candidate directions and reference line.

By using the POM, the safest path with the minimum risk values is chosen from 12 acceleration-based trajectory directions. The global optimal trajectory is then planned using the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT?) algorithm. The planned vehicle motion profile is generated as the reference for future control.

Often no marked reference points are available in environments, which are a large enough to cover a car for the system calibration. In this contribution, a calibration method for a vehicle camera system with non-overlapping camera groups in an urban environment is described. A-priori images of an urban calibration environment taken with an external camera are processed with the structure-from-motion method to obtain an environment point cloud. Images of the vehicle interior, taken also with an external camera, are processed to obtain an interior point cloud. Both point clouds are tied to each other with images of both image sets showing the same real-world objects. The point clouds are transformed into a self-defined vehicle coordinate system describing the vehicle movement. On demand, videos can be recorded with the vehicle cameras in a calibration drive. Poses of vehicle environment cameras and interior cameras are estimated separately using ground control points from the respective point cloud.

    "[2266\t,0,0,\"Vehicle tracking in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) relies on associating vehicle detections across multiple WAMI frames to form tracks corresponding to individual vehicles. The temporal window length, i.e., the number M of sequential frames, over which associations are collectively estimated poses a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. A larger M improves performance because the increased temporal context enables the use of motion models and allows occlusions and spurious detections to be handled better. The number of total hypotheses tracks, on the other hand, grows exponentially with increasing M, making larger values of M computationally challenging to tackle. In this paper, we introduce stochastic progressive association across multiple frames, an iterative approach that progressively grows M with each iteration to improve estimated tracks by exploiting the enlarged temporal context while keeping computation manageable through two novel approaches for pruning association hypotheses. First, guided by a road network, accurately co-registered to the WAMI frames, we disregard unlikely associations that do not agree with the road network. Second, as M is progressively enlarged at each iteration, the related increase in association hypotheses is limited by revisiting only the subset of association possibilities rendered open by stochastically determined dis-associations for the previous iteration. The stochastic dis-association at each iteration maintains each estimated association according to an estimated probability for confidence, obtained via a probabilistic model. Associations at each iteration are then estimated globally over the M frames by (approximately) solving a binary integer programming problem for selecting a set of compatible tracks.

    "[2274\t,0,0,\"Vehicles with car-like kinematics are ubiquitous, therefore an ability to algorithmize (i.e., how to plan and effectively execute) complex maneuvers in the presence of obstacles is vital to mobile robotics and intelligent vehicles. Traditionally, this problem is solved using the well known motion planning algorithms, which generate the open-loop control signals neglecting the effects of measurement noises, modeling uncertainties and imperfect robot actuation. While such effects can be compensated to some extent by online replanning, the application of feedback control algorithms to motion execution is unavoidable if robustness of the system is desired. Consequently, the recent works focus on integration of both motion planning and control algorithms to obtain motion plans robust to uncertainty of the initial conditions. In accordance with this trend, we propose a modified VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law, which is designed to satisfy the state and input constraints resulting from the presence of obstacles in the environment, respect the steering angle limits in conjunction with steering dynamics of the car-like robot, and preserve continuity of the control input signals. Thanks to analytic characterization of admissible funnels (i.e. positively invariant subsets of the configuration space) developed from an analysis of the VFO control law, we guarantee satisfaction of all the mentioned constraints in the continuous domains of time and configuration space of the robot without sacrificing computational efficiency of the planning process.

The presented paper proposes a novel velocity planning method with minimum moving time on the basis of path curvature which is accomplished in three steps. First, the assigned path is divided into some elementary parts based on the path curvature. Second, the velocity planning is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem by assuming the velocity of vehicle to be a specific cubic polynomial on every elementary part to avoid a sudden acceleration in path switching. Finally, we use a modified projection particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to obtain the time-optimal velocity profile. The proposed method can generate a smooth time-optimal velocity profile while considering all possible relevant constraints. Three examples are provided on different types of path to demonstrate that the final velocity profile is efficient to avoid the sudden acceleration change.

    "[2281\t,0,0,\"Visual servoing approaches navigate a robot to the desired pose with respect to a given object using image measurements. As a result, these approaches have several applications in manipulation, navigation and inspection. However, existing visual servoing approaches are instance specific, that is, they control camera motion between two views of the same object. In this paper, we present a framework for visual servoing to a novel object instance. We further employ our framework for the autonomous inspection of vehicles using Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which is vital for day-to-day maintenance, damage assessment, and merchandising a vehicle. This visual inspection task comprises the MAV visiting the essential parts of the vehicle, for example, wheels, lights, and so forth, to get a closer look at the damages incurred. Existing methods for autonomous inspection could not be extended for vehicles due to the following reasons: First, several existing methods require a 3D model of the structure, which is not available for every vehicle. Second, existing methods require expensive depth sensor for localization and path planning. Third, current approaches do not account for the semantic understanding of the vehicle, which is essential for identifying parts. Our instance invariant visual servoing framework is capable of autonomously navigating to every essential part of a vehicle for inspection and can be initialized from any random pose. To the best our knowledge, this is the first approach demonstrating fully autonomous visual inspection of vehicles using MAVs.

Furthermore, uncertainties in the initial states of the cooperative vehicles, e.g. due to sensor noise, can be easily integrated.

The goal is to estimate the position of one or more vehicles from a sequence of range measurements to fixed or moving acoustic beacons with known locations. In contrast to most range-based positioning algorithms, we address the case where the currents are unknown and seek to estimate them explicitly as well. This increases the complexity of the problem at hand and raises interesting observability issues. In particular, the vehicles must undergo sufficiently exciting maneuvers so as to maximize the range-based information available for joint current/multiple vehicle position estimation. The main contribution of the paper is the computation of vehicle trajectories for range-based vehicle positioning system in the presence of constant, unknown currents by maximizing the determinant of a suitable Fisher information matrix (FIM), subject to collision avoidance and maneuvering constraints. A numerical solution is proposed for the general set-up of multiple vehicles and beacons. Analytical solutions are obtained for the case of one vehicle and one static beacon.

Furthermore, we consider scenarios where these plans must be generated in real time, because constraints such as obstacles in the environment may not be known until they are perceived (with a noisy sensor) at runtime. Our approach is to pre-compute a library of `funnels` along different maneuvers of the system that the state is guaranteed to remain within (despite bounded disturbances) when the feedback controller corresponding to the maneuver is executed. We leverage powerful computational machinery from convex optimization (sums-of-squares programming in particular) to compute these funnels. The resulting funnel library is then used to sequentially compose motion plans at runtime while ensuring the safety of the robot. A major advantage of the work presented here is that by explicitly taking into account the effect of uncertainty, the robot can evaluate motion plans based on how vulnerable they are to disturbances. We demonstrate and validate our method using extensive hardware experiments on a small fixed-wing airplane avoiding obstacles at high speed (?12 mph), along with thorough simulation experiments of ground vehicle and quadrotor models navigating through cluttered environments.

The analysis of problems like this is extremely important practically, especially given the growing interest in utilizing unmanned aircraft systems for civil purposes. The direct solution of this problem by solving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality (VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computation complexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VI cannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a common scheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning by considering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as time-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a double-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying within a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the double-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the optimal control for each vehicle.

    "[2299\t,0,0,\"We design and compare three different optimal control strategies for the motion planning of automated vehicles approaching an intersection with scheduled arrivals. The objective is to minimize a combination of energy consumption and deviation from the schedule. The strategies differ in allowed deviations. When taking only vehicles inside the control region into account, the strategy that achieves the lowest energy consumption is the less strict one, albeit at the expense of higher travel times. When traffic conditions beyond the control region are considered, no strategy is able to achieve lower energy consumption or vehicle delay than the strategy that is the most strict in keeping with the schedule. Results suggests that in high traffic situations, from a global energy consumption standpoint, it is best to have vehicles crossing the intersection as soon as possible. © 2018 European Control Association (EUCA).\"],\n",
    "[2300\t,1,0,\"We discuss an implementation of the RRT* optimal motion planning algorithm for the half-car dynamical model to enable autonomous high-speed driving. To develop fast solutions of the associated local steering problem, we observe that the motion of a special point (namely, the front center of oscillation) can be modeled as a double integrator augmented with fictitious inputs. We first map the constraints on tire friction forces to constraints on these augmented inputs, which provides instantaneous, state-dependent bounds on the curvature of geometric paths feasibly traversable by the front center of oscillation. Next, we map the vehicle's actual inputs to the augmented inputs. The local steering problem for the half-car dynamical model can then be transformed to a simpler steering problem for the front center of oscillation, which we solve efficiently by first constructing a curvature-bounded geometric path and then imposing a suitable speed profile on this geometric path.

    "[2304\t,0,0,\"We introduce a system for automatically generating paths for autonomous underwater vehicles which optimize views of a site of interest. These paths can then be used to survey and map underwater sites of interest using photogrammetry. Paths are generated in a virtual world by a single-query probabilistic roadmap algorithm that quickly covers the configuration space and generates small maps with good coverage. The objective function used to compute the paths measures an approximate view coverage by casting rays from the virtual view to test for intersections with the region of interest, with added weight for views with high information gain. The motion planning algorithm was implemented in a virtual world that includes the ability to test paths and acquire views of the virtual scene for evaluation prior to real world deployment. To measure the effectiveness of our paths versus the commonly used pre-packaged lawnmower paths, photogrammetry reconstructions were compared using CloudCompare. The 3D reconstructions created from the views along the paths generated by our algorithm were more detailed and showed better coverage, creating point clouds with a mean distance between points ranging from 1.5 to 2.3 times better than that of the lawnmower pattern.

We show that our algorithm can readily be accelerated on a GPU, and demonstrate it on an autonomous passenger vehicle. © 2011 IEEE.\"],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

A focused search is performed in the previously identified region in which the optimal trajectory is most likely to exist. The main contribution of this paper is a computationally efficient planner which handles dynamic environments generically. The Dynamic Programming algorithm is used to explore in spatiotemporal space and find a coarse trajectory solution first that encodes desirable maneuvers. Then a focused trajectory search is conducted using the generate-and-test approach, and the best trajectory is selected based on the smoothness of the trajectory. Analysis shows that our scheme provides a principled way to focus trajectory sampling, thus greatly reduces the search space.

    "[2320\t,0,0,\"We present a motion planner for the autonomous navigation of UAVs that manages motion and sensing uncertainty at planning time. By doing so, optimal paths in terms of probability of collision, traversal time and uncertainty are obtained. Moreover, our approach takes into account the real dimensions of the UAV in order to reliably estimate the probability of collision from the predicted uncertainty. The motion planner relies on a graduated fidelity state lattice and a novel multi-resolution heuristic which adapt to the obstacles in the map. This allows managing the uncertainty at planning time and yet obtaining solutions fast enough to control the UAV in real time. Experimental results show the reliability and the efficiency of our approach in different real environments and with different motion models. Finally, we also report planning results for the reconstruction of 3D scenarios, showing that with our approach the UAV can obtain a precise 3D model autonomously. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"],\n",

The motion planner takes advantages of the sparse stable trees (SST), the RRT? algorithm and the model predictive control (MPC) design.

A goal-biased input is used to achieve a fast convergence. A nonlinear MPC is used to compute and find the attracting area for the generated trajectory with consideration of constraints of the system.

In order to realise real-time applicability, we split the computation into an online and an offline phase and we utilise symmetries in the open-loop optimal control problem to reduce the number of multiobjective optimal control problems that need to be solved in the offline phase.

The proposed approach does not require complete controllability of the vehicle model in the presence of workspace constraints, and no linearization of the model is involved.

    "[2327\t,0,0,\"We present a novel method for planning coverage paths for inspecting complex structures on the ocean floor using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our method initially uses a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) prior bathymetric map to plan a nominal coverage path that allows the AUV to pass its sensors over all points on the target area. The nominal path uses a standard mowing-the-lawn pattern in effectively planar regions, while in regions with substantial 3D relief it follows horizontal contours of the terrain at a given offset distance. We then go beyond previous approaches in the literature by considering the vehicle's state uncertainty rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption of an idealized path execution. Toward that end, we present a replanning algorithm based on a stochastic trajectory optimization that reshapes the nominal path to cope with the actual target structure perceived in situ. The replanning algorithm runs onboard the AUV in real time during the inspection mission, adapting the path according to the measurements provided by the vehicle's range-sensing sonars. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of state-of-the-art surface reconstruction techniques we apply to the data acquired by the AUV to obtain 3D models of the inspected structures that show the benefits of our planning method for 3D mapping.

While the leading AUV follows a safe, pre-planned survey path, the second vehicle, herein referred to as Camera Vehicle (CV), must survey the bottom in close proximity while following the leader, complementing its survey capabilities. Due to their proximity to the bottom, the CV is exposed to a collision threat. We address this problem by incrementally building a 3D map of the environment onboard the leading vehicle by means of its multibeam sonar. Using this map, we plan on-line 3D paths that are transferred to the CV for close and safe surveying of the bottom. These paths are planned using the Transition-based RRT (T-RRT) algorithm, which is an RRT-variant that considers a cost function defined over the vehicle's configuration space, or costmap for short. By defining a costmap in terms of distance to the bottom and path distance, we are able to keep the paths at a desired offset distance from the bottom for constant-resolution surveying.

    "[2337\t,0,0,\"We present an approach in which an open-source software infrastructure is used for testing the behavior of autonomous vehicles through computer simulation. This software infrastructure is called CAVE, from Connected Autonomous Vehicle Emulator. As a software platform that allows rapid, low-cost and risk-free testing of novel designs, methods and software components, CAVE accelerates and democratizes research and development activities in the field of autonomous navigation. CAVE is (a) heterogeneous and multi-agent, in that it supports the simulation of heterogeneous traffic scenarios involving conventional, assisted, and autonomous vehicles as well as pedestrians and cyclists; (b) open platform, as it allows any client that subscribes to a standard application programming interface (API) to remotely plug into the emulator and engage in multi-participant traffic scenarios that bring together autonomous agents from different solution providers; (c) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication emulation ready, owing to its ability to simulate the V2V data exchange enabled in real-world scenarios by ad-hoc dedicated short range communication (DSRC) protocols; and (d) open-source, as the software infrastructure will be available under a BSD3 license in a public repository for unrestricted use and redistribution. CAVE provides three immediate benefits. First, it serves as a development platform for algorithms that seek to establish path planning policies for autonomous vehicles operating in heterogeneous traffic scenarios; i.e., it enables the rapid and safe testing of `work in progress` piloting computer programs (PCPs). Second, it enables auditing of existing path planning policies by exposing connected and/or autonomous vehicles to scenarios that would be costly, time consuming and/or dangerous to consider in real-world testing. Third, the CAVE will provide a scalable, high-throughput, virtual proving ground that exposes heterogeneous traffic complexity which would not otherwise emerge in actual single-vehicle testing conducted in controlled environments.

    "[2338\t,1,1,\"We present an approach to assess the risk taken by on-road vehicles within the framework of artificial field theory, envisioned for safety analysis and design of driving support/automation applications. Here, any obstacle (neighboring entity on the road) to the subject vehicle is treated as a finite scalar risk field that is formulated in the predicted configuration space of the subject vehicle. The driving risk estimate is the strength of the risk field at the subject vehicle's future location. This risk field is formulated as the product of two factors: collision probability and expected crash energy. The collision probability with neighboring vehicles is estimated based on probabilistic motion predictions. The risk can be assessed for a single time step or over multiple future time steps, depending on the required temporal resolution of the estimates. We verified the single step approach in three near-crash situations from a naturalistic dataset and in cut-in and hard-braking scenarios with simulation and showed the application of the multi-step approach in selecting the safest path in a lane-drop section. The risk descriptions from the proposed approach qualitatively reflect the narration of the situation and are in general consistent with Time To Collision. Compared to current surrogate measures of safety, the proposed risk estimate provides a better basis to assess the driving safety of an individual vehicle by considering the uncertainty over the future ambient traffic state and magnitude of expected crash consequences. The proposed driving risk model can be used as a component of intelligent vehicle safety applications and as a comprehensive surrogate measure for assessing traffic safety. © 2020 The Author(s)\"],\n",
    "[2339\t,0,0,\"We present an approach to endow an autonomous underwater vehicle with the capabilities to move through unexplored environments. To do so, we propose a computational framework for planning feasible and safe paths. The framework allows the vehicle to incrementally build a map of the surroundings, while simultaneously (re)planning a feasible path to a specified goal. To accomplish this, the framework considers motion constraints to plan feasible 3D paths, that is, those that meet the vehicle’s motion capabilities. It also incorporates a risk function to avoid navigating close to nearby obstacles. Furthermore, the framework makes use of two strategies to ensure meeting online computation limitations. The first one is to reuse the last best known solution to eliminate time-consuming pruning routines. The second one is to opportunistically check the states’ risk of collision. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use the Sparus II performing autonomous missions in different real-world scenarios. These experiments consist of simulated and in-water trials for different tasks. The conducted tasks include the exploration of challenging scenarios such as artificial marine structures, natural marine structures, and confined natural environments.

The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection.

The second stage uses the resulting hybrid A? trajectory as an initial guess to an optimal control problem (OCP) solver. In addition to providing the OCP with a warm start, we use the initial guess to create convex regions encoded as halfspace descriptions, which converts the inherent nonconvex obstacle constraints into a convex and smooth representation. The OCP uses this representation in order to optimize the initial guess within a collision-free corridor. The OCP solves the trajectory planning problem in continuous state space.

As a motivating example, we consider the case where a group of vehicles is tasked to reach a number of target points at the same time (simultaneous arrival problem) without colliding among themselves and with obstacles, subject to the requirement that the overall energy required for vehicle motion be minimized. With the theoretical setup adopted, the vehicle dynamics are explicitly taken into account at the planning level. This paper formulates the problem of multiple-vehicle motion planning in a rigorous mathematical setting, describes the optimization algorithm used to solve it, and discusses the key implementation details. The efficacy of the method is illustrated through numerical examples for the simultaneous arrival problem. The initial guess to start the optimization procedure is obtained from simple geometrical considerations, e.g., by joining the desired initial and final positions of the vehicles via straight lines. Even though the initial trajectories thus obtained may result in intervehicle and vehicle/obstacle collisions, we show that the optimization procedure that we employ in this paper will generate collision-free trajectories that also minimize the overall energy spent by each vehicle and meet the required temporal and spatial constraints. The method developed applies to a very general class of vehicles; however, for clarity of exposition, we adopt as an illustrative example the case of wheeled robots. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

The method uses the tangent-arc-tangent-arc-tangent model to plan a path that satisfies two requirements: 1) the own vehicle modeled as a rigid body with a shape and direction doesn't collide with moving obstacles on the path (i.e., the path is collisionless); 2) the path takes into account the vehicle dynamics (this is accomplished through a feedback control). The second requirement is necessary even if the planned path is collisionless because skids while the vehicle is actually running may lead to collisions with obstacles.

    "[2357\t,1,1,\"We propose an approach to classify possible interaction types between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians based on the idea of resource competition in shared spaces. Autonomous vehicles are more challenged in urban traffic scenarios as lots of uncertainties influence the current world model. Urban environments impose very little constraints on the motion of pedestrians. This creates the demand for an approach to determine intentions for each pedestrian as far ahead as possible and to react to changes early. A motion model based on goal-driven pedestrian movement shows a set of most likely planned trajectories. These are analyzed for overlapping occupation times in road segments, thus interactions with the vehicle. The output is an early estimation which suggests most probable interaction types and places. From this estimation, current trajectory of the pedestrian is used to refine the prediction of the most probable intention of interaction place and type. In the end the algorithm combines topological and behavioral input to infer and validate long term intention of interaction type before being able to actually infer the interaction from current dynamics.In terms of a proof-of-concept, the applicability of the approach is validated on real world scenarios from the Cityscapes data set. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

Two tests were completed: (i) 1-AUV time-optimal tests and (ii) 2-AUV race tests where one AUV followed a time-optimal path and the other a shortest-distance path between the start and finish locations. The time-optimal planning proceeded as follows. We first forecast, in real-time, the physical ocean conditions in the above regions and times utilizing our MSEAS multi-resolution primitive equation ocean modeling system. Next, we planned time-optimal paths for the AUVs using our level-set equations and real-time ocean forecasts, and accounting for operational constraints (e.g. minimum depth).

Practical application of data from weigh-in-motion has become more common recently, which calls for adequate attention to data quality. This issue is addressed in the presented paper. The aim of the article is to investigate the accuracy of 77 operative weigh-in-motion stations by analysing steering axle load spectra. The proposed methodology and analysis enabled the identification of scale and source of errors that occur in measurements delivered from weigh-in-motion systems. For this purpose, selected factors were investigated, including the type of axle load sensor, air temperature and vehicle speed. The results of the analysis indicated the obvious effect of the axle load sensor type on the measurement results. It was noted that systematic error increases during winter, causing underestimation of axle loads by 5% to 10% for quartz piezoelectric and bending beam load sensors, respectively. A deterioration of system accuracy is also visible when vehicle speed decreases to 30 km/h. For 25% to 35% of cases, depending on the type of sensor, random error increases for lower speeds, while it remains at a constant level at higher speeds.

This study focuses on developing a systematic methodology to detect weigh-in-motion sensor bias and enhance current practices for weigh-in-motion calibration. A mixture modeling technique using an expectation maximization algorithm was developed to divide the vehicle class 9 gross vehicle weight into three normally distributed components: unloaded, partially loaded, and fully loaded trucks. Then the well-known statistical process control technique cumulative sum control chart analysis was applied to expectation maximization estimates of daily mean gross vehicle weight for fully loaded trucks to identify and estimate shifts in the weigh-in-motion sensor. Special attention was given to the presence of autocorrelation in the data by fitting an autoregressive time-series model and then performing cumulative sum control chart analysis on the fitted residuals. Results from the analysis suggest that the proposed methodology is able to estimate a shift in the weigh-in-motion sensor accurately and also indicate the time point when the system went out of calibration.

    "[2371\t,1,1,\"What is distinctive about a bringing a learning perspective to moral psychology? Part of the answer lies in the remarkable transformations that have taken place in learning theory over the past two decades, which have revealed how powerful experience-based learning can be in the acquisition of abstract causal and evaluative representations, including generative models capable of attuning perception, cognition, affect, and action to the physical and social environment. When conjoined with developments in neuroscience, these advances in learning theory permit a rethinking of fundamental questions about the acquisition of moral understanding and its role in the guidance of behavior. For example, recent research indicates that spatial learning and navigation involve the formation of non-perspectival as well as ego-centric models of the physical environment, and that spatial representations are combined with learned information about risk and reward to guide choice and potentiate further learning. Research on infants provides evidence that they form non-perspectival expected-value representations of agents and actions as well, which help them to navigate the human environment. Such representations can be formed by highly-general mental processes such as causal and empathic simulation, and thus afford a foundation for spontaneous moral learning and action that requires no innate moral faculty and can exhibit substantial autonomy with respect to community norms. If moral learning is indeed integral with the acquisition and updating of casual and evaluative models, this affords a new way of understanding well-known but seemingly puzzling patterns in intuitive moral judgment—including the notorious “trolley problems.” © 2016 The Author\"],\n",

Based on basic RRT and combined with the kinematic constraints of the intelligent vehicle, the homocentric circles sampling strategy and adjacent point selection method were introduced in the proposed algorithm. The homocentric circles sampling considers the target point as the center; the homocentric circles coefficient m was used to adjust the density of the homocentric circles to generate random points to determine the next path point. Considering the vehicle kinematic constraints and target distance factor, the adjacent point selection method was adopted to calculate the proximity coefficient, and the random tree node corresponding to the minimum proximity coefficient was taken as the adjacent point. For the planned path, a path processing method based on vehicle kinematic constraints was used to simplify the obtained path, and the cubic B-spline curve was employed to optimize the path to generate a smooth and executable path. The results show that the algorithm takes the least time to find the path when the coefficient of homocentric circles is in the range of 0.5-1.5. A larger constraint value for the angle of vehicle attitude and next path point implies that less time is used to find the path and it tends to be stable when the angle is 35°. Under the same environment, the quality of the planned path obtained using the proposed RRT improves considerably compared with the basic RRT, target bias RRT, and updated RRT.

The trace of the flux tensor provides robust spatio-temporal information of moving edges including the motion of tall structures caused by parallax effects. The parallax induced motions are filtered out by incorporating building depth maps obtained from dense urban 3D point clouds. Using a level-set based geodesic active contours framework, the coarse thresholded tall structures depth masks evolved and stopped at the actual building boundaries. Experiments are carried out on a cropped 2k × 2k region of interest for 200 frames from Albuquerque urban aerial imagery. An average precision of 83% and recall of 76% have been reported using an object-level detection performance evaluation method. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

This paper addresses some of the safety measures that can be taken to improve and assess the safety of BVI pedestrians in a controlled environment like a BVI school campus where autonomous vehicles are operated. The majority of research on autonomous vehicle safety does not consider the edge cases of encounters with BVI pedestrians.

    "[2399\t,1,1,\"With the advent of seemingly unstructured big data, and through seamless integration of computation and physical components, cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide an innovative way to enhance safety and resiliency of transport infrastructure. This study focuses on real-world microscopic driving behavior and its relevance to school zone safety – expanding the capability, usability, and safety of dynamic physical systems through data analytics. Driving behavior and school zone safety is a public health concern. The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations prior to involvement in safety critical events, defined as driving volatility, can be a leading indicator of safety. By harnessing unique naturalistic data on more than 41,000 normal, crash, and near-crash events featuring over 9.4 million temporal samples of real-world driving, a characterization of volatility in microscopic driving decisions is sought at school and non-school zone locations. A big data analytic methodology is proposed for quantifying driving volatility in microscopic real-world driving decisions. Eight different volatility measures are then linked with detailed event-specific characteristics, health history, driving history/experience, and other factors to examine crash propensity at school zones. A comprehensive yet fully flexible state-of-the-art generalized mixed logit framework is employed to fully account for distinct yet related methodological issues of scale and random heterogeneity, containing multinomial logit, random parameter logit, scaled logit, hierarchical scaled logit, and hierarchical generalized mixed logit as special cases. The results reveal that both for school and non-school locations, drivers exhibited greater intentional volatility prior to safety-critical events. Volatility in positive and negative vehicular jerk in longitudinal and lateral directions associates with increases the probability of unsafe outcomes (crashes or near-crashes) at school zones. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility measured by positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction associates with a 0.0528 increase in the probability of crash outcome. Importantly, the effect of negative vehicular jerk (braking) in longitudinal direction on the likelihood of crash outcome is almost double. Methodologically, Hierarchical Generalized Mixed Logit model resulted in best-fit, simultaneously accounting for scale and random heterogeneity. When accounted for separately, more parsimonious models accounting for scale heterogeneity performed comparably to the less parsimonious counterparts accounting for random heterogeneity. Importantly, even after accounting for random heterogeneity, substantial heterogeneity due to a “pure scale-effect” is still observed, underscoring the importance of scale effects in influencing the overall contours of variations in the modeled relationships. The study demonstrates the value of observational study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes.

Under this guidance model, the work area of AGV can be divided into multiple rectangle regions, a two-dimensional code is deployed at each intersection of these regions, which carries the guidance information for its neighborhood regions. The AGV walks along a path which is obtained from the central server, and by scanning the two-dimensional code it encountered, it acquires the way to the next node in the path, until it reaches the endpoint.

However, due to computational intractability, the investigation of network-level AV control is still at the initial stage. This study proposes a space-time routing framework applicable in dedicated AV zones. To relieve the computational load, we establish a node-based conflict point network to model realistic road networks, and at each conflict point, we record the space-time occupations of AVs in continuous timelines. Then, based on the conflict point network, we develop two space-time routing algorithms for each AV once it enters the dedicated AV zone to minimize its trip travel time while maintaining the non-collision insurances; these two algorithms can trade-off between solution quality and computational load. Furthermore, to enhance the network throughput for handling heavy traffic, we develop a ”platoon strategy” that forces AVs to pass through conflict points in platoons, and we adopt Deep Q-learning (DQN) to optimize the platoon sizes at different spots dynamically. Numerical tests show that both proposed algorithms perform well in that they can execute the routing tasks with very limited computational time, and the average vehicle delay approaches zero when the traffic is relatively mild.

    "[2413\t,0,0,\"With the increasing complexity, dynamicity and uncertainty of traffic, motion planning of automatic driving is getting more difficult and challenging. This paper focuses on the real-time motion planning problem of CAVs (connected and automated vehicles) in complex traffic scenarios. To effectively solve this problem, a general driving risk model is presented, which contains the following two essential parts: i) collision risk, i.e., the collision risk between the SV (subject vehicle) and other surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, buildings etc.; ii) non-collision risk, such as violation of traffic regulations, the deviation from the intention of driver, etc. To achieve the real time collision detection, the SV is approximated to a point and its shape is considered by extending the dimension of obstacles considering their relative position and velocity. Then an index similar to the exponential function is defined to calculate the collision risk value, which is composed of the collision detection result and TTC (time to collision). The index of non-collision risk is measured by the deviation from the desired states including regulations, driving manners and intentions etc. Accordingly, a motion planning algorithm by minimizing the aforementioned risk is proposed to calculate the required speed and yaw angle, considering the constraints of vehicle dynamics. Bench tests have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed motion planning algorithm. The results show that it can safely handle a variety of complex traffic scenarios, such as lane change with a front vehicle cutting in suddenly, meanwhile the traffic regulations and vehicle dynamics constraints can also be met.

    "[2415\t,0,0,\"With the increasing popularity of GPS Systems and vehicle navigation devices, an increasing number of drivers are accustomed to plotting their travel routes through using intelligent navigation devices. For most existing routing methods, the results of path planning are merely depending on urban roads' geographic information, historical travel information or the real-time traffic status provided by traffic information centers. However, since the number of vehicles is continuously increasing in the urban environment, the interaction among vehicles has become one of the most significant factors that affects the travel time. Thus, those existing routing methods are not suitable for the demands of current urban navigation. To address this new challenge, it is necessary to design an improved routing method, which can consider the mutual interactions among urban vehicles. Recently, the Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) has been one of the most promising achievements for the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in terms of vehicular information transmission. In VANET, taking advantage of vehicular onboard network devices and Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) protocol, the vehicles can achieve real-time communication with other vehicles or urban infrastructures. Moreover, vehicles can share their routing planning and retrieve real-time traffic information from the Intelligent Transportation System Center via these communication technologies. Nevertheless, it is still a serious and realistic challenge to make more accurate prediction of vehicles' routing planning when it considers the dynamic changes of future traffic status in road; especially the changes are resulted from the current routing planning. Therefore, this paper proposes a collaborative route planning method (CoRP), which is more rational and adaptable for urban vehicles to plot their travel routes. In this paper, we firstly give an analysis to the vehicle running process and the interactions among vehicles. Based on the above analysis, we draw a conclusion that the travel process of urban vehicles can be converted into a queuing problem. Furthermore, we quantify the interaction among those urban vehicles while they are making travel planning, and then put forward a quantify algorithm to evaluate their interactions. At last, we come up with an optimal method targeting at minimizing total time spend (TTS) for routing vehicles. Given the proposed method, CoRP can reduce the negative influence on each vehicle in the routing process, and can provide more rational and practical routing plans for urban drivers. The simulation shows that CoRP can decrease the number of retarded vehicles on the road by 18%-30%, and reduce the total time spend of all vehicles by 14%-29% when compared to some classical routing methods. Therefore, the proposed CoRP can enhance the collaboration among vehicles, and it is more practical for the real urban environment. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.\"],\n",

Whilst smart sensors provide information about the state of the perceived objects, considering the spatio-temporal relationships between them with respect to the subject vehicle remains a challenge. This paper proposes to fill this gap by using contextual information to infer how perceived entities are expected to behave, and thus what are the consequences of these behaviours on the subject vehicle. For this purpose, an ontology is formulated about the vehicle, perceived entities and context (map information) to provide a conceptual description of all road entities with their interaction. It allows for inferences of knowledge about the situation of the subject vehicle with respect to the environment in which it is navigating. The framework is applied to the navigation of a vehicle as it approaches road intersections, to demonstrate its applicability.

    "[2431\t,0,0,\"Within the context of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles this paper proposes methods for efficient encoding of motion primitives in neural networks on top of model-based and gradient-free reinforcement learning. It is distinguished between 5 core aspects: system model, network architecture, training algorithm, training tasks selection and hardware/software implementation. For the system model, a kinematic (3-states-2-controls) and a dynamic (16-states-2-controls) vehicle model are compared. For the network architecture, 3 feedforward structures are compared including weighted skip connections. For the training algorithm, virtual velocity constraints and network scheduling are proposed. For the training tasks, different feature vector selections are discussed. For the implementation, aspects of gradient-free learning using 1 GPU and the handling of perturbation noise therefore are discussed. The effects of proposed methods are illustrated in experiments encoding up to 14625 motion primitives. The capabilities of tiny neural networks with as few as 10 scalar parameters when scheduled on vehicle velocity are emphasized. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[2432\t,0,0,\"Within this paper a new path planning algorithm for autonomous robotic exploration and inspection is presented. The proposed method plans online in a receding horizon fashion by sampling possible future configurations in a geometric random tree. The choice of the objective function enables the planning for either the exploration of unknown volume or inspection of a given surface manifold in both known and unknown volume. Application to rotorcraft Micro Aerial Vehicles is presented, although planning for other types of robotic platforms is possible, even in the absence of a boundary value solver and subject to nonholonomic constraints. Furthermore, the method allows the integration of a wide variety of sensor models. The presented analysis of computational complexity and thorough simulations-based evaluation indicate good scaling properties with respect to the scenario complexity. Feasibility and practical applicability are demonstrated in real-life experimental test cases with full on-board computation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\"],\n",
    "[2433\t,0,0,\"Worldwide, the use of mobile robot has been growing rapidly. In aerospace, for instance, mobile robot have become ubiquitous in both military and civilian applications. Today, for example, unmanned air vehicles must execute military reconnaissance and strike operations, border patrol missions, forest fire detection, police surveillance, and recovery operations. In this research, an arrival time field based path planning algorithm is addressed. We used arrival time field to generate bias which gives larger weights for shorter and safer paths toward a goal. The path will be extracted by backtracking the nodes that reach the goal, and the motion from the very first node will be sent to the robot controller. © 2016 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[2435\t,0,0,\"microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robot platform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and unique multi-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVP can be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six micro vehicles, each measuring 8 × 5 × 6 cubic centimeters and weighing under 100 grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fully assembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In this paper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and the design thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities of microMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot path and motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[2437\t,1,1,\"stefano.feraco@polito.it This paper presents a technique based on the probabilistic road map algorithm for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. The objective is to provide an algorithm allowing to compute the trajectory of the vehicle by reducing the distance traveled and minimizing the lateral deviation and relative yaw angle of the vehicle with respect to the reference trajectory, while maximizing its longitudinal speed. The vehicle is considered as a 3 Degree-of-Freedom bicycle model and a Model Predictive Control algorithm is implemented to control the lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Both the control and trajectory generation algorithms take the road lane boundaries as the only input from the surrounding environment exploiting a simulated camera. The performance of the technique is compared with the case in which the reference trajectory is the central line between the lane boundaries. The proposed algorithm is validated in a simulated driving scenario. Copyright © 2020 ASME.\"],\n",
