    "[1  ,1,1,\"125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner. The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations. The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic.

    "[2  ,0,0,\"3D object detection is becoming increasingly significant for emerging autonomous vehicles. Safety decision making and motion planning depend highly on the result of 3D object detection. Recent 3D detection models are optimized for cars, cyclists and pedestrians with multiple models. This is not desirable because multiple models require significant resources, which are also used for other algorithms, such as localization or object tracking. We present SECOND-DX for providing multi-class support for 3D object detection with only a single model and it enables the detection of all three classes of 3D objects scanned using LiDAR sensors in real time. We conducted experiments involving the KITTI 3D object dataset to show that SECOND-DX is more accuracy overall evaluation metrics without compromising execution speed when compared with algorithms extended to support multi-class detection with a single model. Additionally, SECOND-DX can detect pedestrian classes comparable with that of current models that are optimized to support only cyclists and pedestrians. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[3  ,0,0,\"3D path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles in search and rescue scenarios is an important research area, due to the ability to explore damage areas that could be inaccessible for vehicles like ground robots.

Further, a multiple variables controller is used to maintain the cooperative UAV formation in a circular orbit during flight, and adaptive estimations for unknown wind conditions and moving targets are used to determine the flight stability of the formation in the circular orbit. Simulation results show that a formation of three UAVs rapidly get close to a target with the same attitude and position while remaining relatively stable, and the relative distance error between any two UAVs rapidly converges to the stable value in the case of unknown wind conditions and moving targets.

    "[15 ,0,0,\"According to an official US survey, traffic accidents at corners in highway accidents are eight times higher than in other road conditions [1]. Therefore, the warning of speed planning for corners is extremely important. This paper proposes a high-speed cornering intelligent speed planning early warning system for commercial vehicles with high-speed cornering that is prone to rollover accidents. Starting from the source of the driving, the system gives a hint to the driver before the cornering, and the slow throttle uses the inertial force to avoid the danger of brake failure caused by excessive braking on the brakes. At the same time, it can ensure that the vehicle leaves the corner at a safe speed to prevent the risk of rollover. Based on the lateral rollover model of the vehicle, the system calculates the critical safe speed of the curve, and combines with the longitudinal dynamics model to obtain the distance position for the slow release throttle to slide. In this paper, Trucksim is used to build a motion simulation platform, and combined with MATLAB simulation, the simulation results show that the sliding distance increases with the increase of the initial velocity and decreases with the increase of the radius of the curve. At the same time, the use of the system greatly reduces the braking time and braking distance, and the fuel economy is improved by about 3%.

    "[39 ,0,0,\"An online path planning and a guidance law method are proposed for the unpowered forced landing problem of the hybrid Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs). According to the casual initial location and heading when the UAV losses power, a three-dimensional path planning method that satisfies both dynamic and terminal constraints is developed. Using the geometric planning method for designing the extended Dubins plane path, three-dimensional curves are generated based on the gliding stability and performance. Since the unpowered path following is susceptible to wind disturbances in low speed and the curvature of planed curves is discontinuous, a three-dimensional guidance algorithm based on nonlinear model predictive control is proposed. Combined with the lateral-longitudinal decoupled guidance dynamic, nonlinear factors such as following error, external wind disturbance and path curvature discontinuity are modeled as the system output constraints, and guide commands are solved through rolling in real time. Finally, the validation of the online path planning method and the guidance law are simulated and verified. The simulation results show that the proposed online planning method is suitable for the emergency landing from casual locations and headings, and the proposed guidance algorithm has the capability to resist wind disturbance and follow the three-dimensional path accurately. © 2019, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

    "[40 ,0,0,\"An unmanned aerial system (UAS) based system has been developed to be able to rapidly localize the source of GNSS interference to minimize the impact interference would have on critical infrastructure, such as an airport. Previously, the project, known as Jammer Acquisition with GPS Exploration and Reconnaissance or JAGER, has demonstrated capabilities of localizing a signal source in real time by physically rotating the antenna, however this approach proved to be a slow approach to localization [1]. Since that demonstration, the sensor has been upgraded to be electronically steered, the localizing algorithm and path planning has been improved to account for the higher rate of bearing measurements, and a GNSS independent navigation system has been developed. Each of these pieces have been demonstrated individually in both flight tests and simulation, however, until now, the full system has not been operated together in real-time [2]-[4]. This paper presents the real-time implementation of all the core sub-systems making up the JAGER platform working together to localizing a signal source in a GNSS denied environment. The JAGER system is made up of three sub-systems: the interference localization system, a GNSS denied navigation system, and a path planning system. The interference localization system is comprised of an electronically beam steered antenna making signal strength measurements to create received signal strength (RSS) patterns from which bearing information can be used to estimate the RFI source location. The GNSS denied navigation system is built around using optical flow from a gimbal stabilized FLIR Systems Boson infrared (IR) camera to measure velocity and in turn estimate the position of the vehicle. Finally, the path planning system sends velocity commands to the autopilot to fly a desired trajectory to get the best bearing measurements for estimating the RFI source. Flight tests were performed at Edwards Air Force Base with a 2W, 5MHz wide, 2.48 GHz signal source being localized by JAGER. The GNSS denied environment was created in software by disabling the use of GNSS by the autopilot for real time guidance and control. The flight tests were conducted at night, in the early morning (pre-sunrise), and in the late morning to stress test the IR based vision system and demonstrate the capabilities in a range of time periods. The location chosen at Edwards Air Force Base also consisted of a large hangar door that presented “urban environment”-like challenges (namely reflections of the signal source). The flight tests comprised of 35 different mission attempts, where a mission consists of starting from a known location and fully autonomously executing the localization of the signal source with no user interaction until the source was determined to be localized. Of the 35 different mission attempts, 16 successfully localized the signal source with an average final 2D localization error of 13m, and the vision system demonstrated a drift rate of 4% and 6.1% during the day and night, respectively. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.\"],\n",

Algorithms that combine heuristic search with local optimization are well suited to domains where solution optimality is favored over speed and memory resources are limited as they often improve the optimality of solutions without increasing the sampling density. To address the runtime performance limitations of such algorithms, this paper introduces Predictively Adapted State Lattices, an extension of recombinant motion planning search space construction that adapts the representation by selecting regions to optimize using a learned model trained to predict the expected improvement. The model aids in prioritizing computations that optimize regions where significant improvement is anticipated.

    "[43 ,0,0,\"Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been brought into the focus of public attention in recent years. The automotive industry can significantly benefit from this - especially in the development of autonomous driving functions and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). In addition to established OEMs, industry startups have been investing large sums of money and enormous efforts in the further development of this technology. Most of the major trends in the automotive industry can be supported by AI-based algorithms. Reliable performance of autonomous driving functions requires fast and error-free acquisition of traffic and environmental situations, for instance by image processing systems. Training the algorithms entails an extremely high investment of time and costs. These algorithms acquire their capabilities through a learning process that is based on training data. In addition to the actual data, this data - at least in supervised learning - contains meta information such as the position and classification of all relevant objects. Today, manual labeling of the training data is a common practice and the reason for the very high expenditure of time and money. Moreover, a large amount of the training data is required with high variance to ensure that all conceivable environmental situations are covered. The quality of the trained neural network depends on the quality of the training data used. Neural networks will only achieve high performance if the training data has been thoroughly annotated with utmost accuracy. Especially the annotation of data from cameras, but also other sensor data requires extremely high manpower investment. High error-proneness in the labeling process is another disadvantage of manual annotation. When algorithms for autonomous driving functions are trained based on such faulty data, it is only logical that they will not be able to accurately function in specific situations. The annotation quality of training data can be clearly enhanced when the annotation of the (image) data, rather than being manually performed by humans, is automated, which is possible for instance with synthetically generated data. The CarMaker open integration and test platform from IPG Automotive provides error-free annotations and significantly reduce manpower requirements. The simulation environment is able to generate synthetic data such as images, which are automatically provided with the corresponding meta information, i.e. automatically labeled. Large training data sets can be efficiently created in this way. If necessary, the training can subsequently be fine-tuned with a reduced amount of real-world data. Furthermore, CarMaker offers the opportunity to integrate the trained deep learning algorithms into a closed-loop environment and to test them in realistic driving situations by means of simulation. It is also possible to test and validate AI-based algorithms using ROS (Robot Operating System) middleware and to thus utilize ROS capabilities for the development of automated driving functions. This complements the simulation with CarMaker by the possibility of using existing ROS models and libraries, for instance for navigation, perception, motion planning and sensor data processing. This paper presents ways in which the effort required for training neural networks can be significantly reduced by means of CarMaker. Based on examples, the authors demonstrate how training data sets that are suitable for training artificial neural networks can be created in simulation. Subsequently, an integration of CarMaker and ROS middleware is described as an approach to testing and validating trained algorithms in a closed-loop environment. © VDI Verlag GmbH · Düsseldorf 2019.\"],\n",

In order to realize the matching of track points in space and time domain, closed-loop prediction is adopted to know the actually tracked path more accurately. Taking the nonlinear characteristics of lateral and longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle and the saturation of actuators into account, a unified conditional integral control law is designed to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the tracking error and to avoid the degradation of actuators performance due to the divergence of the integral operation.

It frees drivers from the burden of maneuvering a vehicle into a narrow parking space. This paper deals with the motion planning, a key issue of APAS, for vehicles in automatic parking. Planning module should guarantee the robustness to various initial postures and ensure that the vehicle is parked symmetrically in the center of the parking slot. However, current planning methods can't meet both requirements well. To meet the aforementioned requirements, a method combining neural network and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is adopted in this work. From a driver's perspective, different initial postures imply different parking strategies. In order to achieve the robustness to diverse initial postures, a natural idea is to train a model that can learn various strategies. As artificial neural network has outstanding potential in representing and learning knowledge, a neural network is utilized to provide prior knowledge, which is trained through supervised learning by a novel method that imitates human learning style. However, the training accuracy and generalization ability of a neural network, together with the quality of training data, will interfere with the robustness and terminal parking performance of a planning module inevitably. To counter this, a particular variant of MCTS (P-MCTS), which can memorize the best sequence with the highest reward, is combined with the neural network to select the final action by taking Monte-Carlo samples among possible candidates produced by the neural network. Compared with the standard MCTS, P-MCTS performs better in one-player puzzle like automatic parking. Using this method, for the planning part, the robustness to various initial postures and good terminal parking performance can be guaranteed simultaneously, which is verified by the simulations of Matlab and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. © 2020 SAE International.

    "[72 ,0,0,\"BACKGROUND: Given a denied or resource-limited area of operations, when air medical evacuation would require extended delay, should dismounted movement through difficult terrain dissuade an attempt of immediate ground evacuation? Understanding the magnitude of external forces during dismounted movement would inform planning in such circumstances. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the mechanical impact experienced during dismounted evacuation from mountainous terrain. We also describe a protocol using a portable accelerometer to evaluate evacuation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A triaxial accelerometer and a semiflexible litter were used to collect data during the Army Mountain Warfare School Rough Terrain Evacuation Course. We used the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, using maximum likelihood estimation, to model maximum acceleration values. RESULTS: It was determined that the accelerometer should be mounted directly onto a mannequin when using semiflexible litters. GEV analysis from a mannequin-mounted trial revealed that for 1-minute evacuation intervals, 10% would have a maximum acceleration over a value between 2.4g and 3.7g. This interval encompasses the maximum acceleration from evacuation using a Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, measured by the US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory. The peak acceleration from a 75-minute, mannequin-mounted trial was 5.5g, approximately twice as large as the MRAP maximum. CONCLUSION: For the evacuee, the acceleration experienced during dismounted evacuation in mountainous terrain can be comparable to MRAP evacuation, especially with sufficient planning that avoids points of maximum impact. Leaders can consider this comparison during planning. 2018.\"],\n",

This paper proposes an anti-collision assisted driving system design for vehicle overtaking.

Firstly, the lane changing process is analyzed. Then based on the research of the optimal path planning strategy for vehicle lane change, two variable path trajectory curve models of polynomial function and sinusoidal function are selected. Finally, the critical collision time point is derived and calculated in combination with the established model. After this time point, the lane change can ensure the safety of driving. The model is simulated and the 'human-car-road' model is established by CarSim: driver control model, vehicle dynamics model and road scene model. And combined with MATLAB, the simulation is carried out from the longitudinal relative speed of the two vehicles and the horizontal relative distance between the two vehicles. The results show that the critical time calculated by the sinusoidal model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is lower, and the critical time calculated by the polynomial curve model is safer when the relative vehicle speed is higher. At the same time, the safety critical time points will decrease as the relative speed and the relative distance increase.

We argue that this design allows principled modular extension of motion planning, in contrast to using either monolithic behavior cloning or a large set of handwritten rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that our state-action space abstraction allows transferring of the trained models without retraining from a simulated environment with virtually no dynamics to one with significantly more realistic dynamics. Together, these results suggest that our proposed hierarchical architecture is a promising way to allow reinforcement learning to be applied to complex multi-lane cruising in the real world. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

In this context, swarms of autonomous inspection robots (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)), that can replace current labor-intensive manual inspections, are examples of edge devices. Such devices need to have on-board data analysis capabilities for efficient inspection path planning. The incorporation of deep learning algorithms into these edge devices for damage detection is a challenging problem since these devices are typically limited in computing and memory resources. For instance, deep transfer learning, which leverages the advantages of pre-trained models, is usually used to detect a new type of damage when there is no sufficient training data. However, the pre-trained models are typically large in size and therefore are not resource efficient for those edge devices. This study introduces a solution to achieve quick inference and low memory demands through transfer learning and network pruning. Network pruning, inspired by the biological brain behavior, eliminates the redundant neurons of the pre-trained network with an iterative pruning and fine-tuning process. Results from comprehensive experiments on two pre-trained networks (i.e., VGG16 and ResNet18) and two types of prevalent surface defects (i.e., crack and corrosion) are presented and discussed in details with respect to damage detection performance, memory demands, and the inference time for damage detection. The experiments show that with the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU, simulating the on-board computing platform, the proposed approach achieves an inference time which is nine and four times faster than the original VGG16 and ResNet18 networks, respectively. Also, the network size is reduced by 80% and 95% for the VGG16 and ResNet18 networks, respectively.

In highway design consistency, vehicle stability is a significant concern to ascertain the safe traffic operation. Vehicles moving on curved roads (horizontal/vertical), experiences the excessive centrifugal forces, which leads to the vehicles roll-over or head-on collision accidents due to the instability of the vehicles. Also, the stability of the vehicles gets impacted by the serpentine motion due to the higher number of passing/overtaking manoeuvre of vehicles on the non-lane based heterogeneous traffic stream. More rapid acceleration, higher operating speeds, and frequent braking operations increases the tire-road frictional demands, causing vehicle instability while driving. Such behaviour increases the driver's discomfort and risk resulting in an unsafe driving condition. Hence, studying the driving behaviourregarding such vehicle's instability is important to know the design consistency level and the safe/unsafebehaviour of the drivers. Literature review yieldsthat the dynamic parameters like speed, lateral and longitudinal acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle are the three primary criteria to determine the driving behaviour. Also, it is observed that braking coefficient (or coefficient of friction) of a road is one of the main criteria to ascertain the safety of any roadway section through the g-g diagram or the friction circle concept. The present paper studied the driving behaviour (regarding risk taking/aggressiveness) of different type of vehicles on various terrain roads (in plain and hilly terrain). The proposed methodology is predicated on the dynamic equilibrium of the vehicles. The g-g diagram and the friction circle concept is used to characterise the driving behaviour.

    "[100,0,0,\"Designing a building for polar stations involves countless cost-benefit trade-offs. One critical decision for planners is whether to elevate structures or place them on the snow surface. For planners wishing to minimize the impact of drifting, elevated structures are generally more desirable, with the tradeoff of added construction cost. Surface-based structures are less expensive to construct, but accumulate drift more rapidly than their elevated counterparts, thus incurring an added recurring expense of snow removal. To estimate this added cost, we quantified the volume of snow drifted on several structures at Summit, Greenland, using structure-from-motion photogrammetry from a small UAV. We find that while the elevated “Bighouse” accumulated negligible drift, the surface-based “Greenhouse” accumulated 4862 ±444 m 3 of snow. We then use estimates of equipment efficiency at snow removal coupled with equipment operating cost to determine the time and cost of snow removal (69 ± 6 h for the Greenhouse). Finally, we analyze a 10-year record of winds from Summit, and estimate the total amount of snow drifted on the structures in any given year. We estimate that the Greenhouse at Summit accumulates an average of 11,702 m 3 of snow per year, and that clearing that snow costs an average of $41,000 per year. The expense of snow removal for surface-based structures should be factored into the total lifetime cost of the building, making elevated structures much more cost-competitive than they may initially appear. © 2018 The Authors\"],\n",

These systems are typically designed for safety and rider comfort. However, these systems are often not designed with the quality of the overall traffic flow in mind. For such a system to be beneficial to the traffic flow, it must be string stable and minimize the inter-vehicle spacing to maximize throughput, while still being safe. We propose a methodology to select autonomous driving system parameters that are both safe and string stable using the existing control framework already implemented on commercially available ACC vehicles.

This paper presents an attention-based recurrent neural network that is capable of accurately predicting the Cartesian trajectories of multiple human driven vehicles over a 3s prediction-horizon. Using only a 1s input sequence the proposed network can predict trajectories three times this length, with an average root mean square error of just 0.497m and a variance of 0.506m.

Different from traditional motion controllers, the motion controller in the proposed scheme is divided into two sub-modules, iterative motion simulator, and motion control operator. In the iterative motion simulator, the vehicle trajectory response is simulated while updating a trajectory offset iteratively. This offset will correct the vehicle response closer to the reference trajectory. After the iterative trajectory adjustment finishes, the simulated tracking error and trajectory offset are sent back to motion planner. The motion planner will first evaluate the simulated trajectory in terms of the response effectiveness, and then send the trajectory with the offset to the motion control operator to calculate the vehicle control maneuver. Comparing with tradition motion planning schemes, the proposed ITO approach can guarantee the trajectory's physical and operational feasibility, make the motion controller have better tracking performance, and have a predictive evaluation on the vehicle response.

Our trajectory planning algorithm is structured such that the spatial and temporal planning is integrated so that both the longitudinal and lateral aspects, reflected in the shape and length of the planned trajectory, are dynamically changing to best negotiate the constraints from road curvature and surrounding vehicles. The concept of a vehicle connected to shadow trolleys traveling along the rails on the road is introduced. Given waypoints, a reference cubic spline can be constructed to define the rail for trolleys and form a curvilinear coordinate. This concept facilitates the description of vehicle motion, trajectories, and surroundings with respect to the trolley, which is especially convenient for a vehicle traveling on high curvature road and switchbacks. A temporal optimization of the trolley instances is first conducted, which in turn allows us to make a proper approximation and reduce an originally complex nonlinear spatial-temporal optimization problem into one that requires only Quadratic Programming (QP). We present simulation results of various challenging scenarios on complex road geometry with multiple surrounding vehicles of varying behavior to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show reasonable, flexible, and safe maneuvers. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[141,0,0,\"In general, the cooperative driving problems for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) consist of two parts: determine the desired arrival times and motion planning. However, most of the existing works don't take positioning errors into account.

Then, an analytical solution of the constructed optimization problem is derived so that it can be solved quickly in practice.

    "[145,0,0,\"In order to improve the efficiency of emergency rescue in expressway emergencies, the traffic conditions, potential risks on the road, and other traffic information were considered in this study of highway emergency rescue vehicle induction. Based on traffic information in a real-time and time-varying road network environment, the goal is to minimize the travel time of vehicles and obtain the strongest path reliability. In this paper, a combined strategy of real-time and time-varying information model is proposed so that the path planning can be adjusted periodically according to changes in road network traffic volume. The dynamic decision-making problem was transformed into a series of static decision-making problems at discrete time points by rolling time-domain strategy, which were then used to calculate the emergency rescue path time. On this basis, the traffic accident rates on a road network were increased, which is likely to cause congestion. This study further considered the reliability of the rescue path planning as the decision target. That is, the emergency rescue vehicle path planning has more adjustment strategies in the face of road interruptions or severe congestion in order to update the rescue path and complete the rescue task as soon as possible. In order to facilitate calculation, the above factors were converted into unified cost values. The research results showed that when the distance between road intersections is relatively large and there are no other road connections in the middle, the road interruptions or congestion caused by the spread of the destruction trend of emergencies in the driving process, the rescue path cannot be updated and adjusted, resulting in rescue delay. Therefore, the vehicle induction optimization model based on rescue time and path reliability can overcome the abovementioned problems and further improve rescue efficiency. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

This generated map is subsequently used as a source of information to perform path planning for each vehicle using a rapidly exploring random belief tree. This algorithm, while connecting start and goal poses with collision-free trajectories, ensures that the vehicles prioritize observing feature-rich areas and never lose sight of features, thus improving localization accuracy.

First, a model of drivers' dissatisfaction was established, which was used as the basis for generating intentions of lane changes. Second, two types of efficiency strategies were built, according to the motion states of obstacles in different lanes, and a prediction engine was designed to forecast and evaluate candidate lanes. The lane with the higher driving efficiency was then selected as the target lane. Third, the minimum safety spacing model of lane changes was applied to ensure safety throughout the whole process of lane changing. The resultant target lane was then provided to the motion planning module, based on an improved artificial potential field, to identify the goals of movement. Finally, a variety of scene tests of the integration algorithms were carried out on the CarSim/PreScan/Simulink co-simulation platform as well as on the hardware-in-the-loop platform. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can generate stable lane change intentions based on the accumulation of drivers' dissatisfaction, select the target lane with higher driving efficiency, guarantee the safety of lane changes throughout the whole process, and deal with unexpected situations such as the sudden acceleration or deceleration of obstacle vehicles. Simultaneously, by changing the target lane, the motion planning module can automatically adjust the vehicle's movement to enable car following and lane changing. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

    "[221,0,0,\"Incorporation of electronic yaw stabilization in on-road vehicles can take many forms. Although the most popular ones are differential braking and torque distribution, a potentially better alternative would be the inclusion of a controller into the steering process. However, this is not often pursued in mechanically-coupled steering systems since the controller could work against the driver's intentions creating potential challenges to safety. The growing adoption of steer-by-wire (SbW) systems now in autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles offers an opportunity to simplify the incorporation of such steering-controller based assistance. Most current steeringassistance systems focus either on adaptive steering control (adaptive power steering and gear ratios) or on total steering control in autopilot functions (lane keeping control). Such steering-controllers (incorporated via SbW modality) can improve driving performance and maneuverability and contribute to the overall suite of active-safety vehicle systems.

This paper proposes such an algorithm for two one-way-streets assuming that only a certain percentage of cars are equipped with this technology. The algorithm enumerates different sequences of cars discharging from the intersection to minimize the objective function. Benefits of platooning (multiple cars consecutively discharging from a queue) and signal flexibility (adaptability to demand) are also considered. The goal is to gain insights about the value (in terms of delay savings) of using connected vehicle technology for intersection control.Simulations are conducted for different total demand values and demand ratios to understand the effects of changing the minimum green time at the signal and the penetration rate of connected cars. Using autonomous vehicle control systems, the signal could rapidly change the direction of priority without relying on the reaction of drivers. However, without this technology a minimum green time is necessary. The results of the simulations show that a minimum green time increases the delay only for the low and balanced demand scenarios. Therefore, the value of using cars with autonomous vehicle control can only be seen at intersections with this kind of demand patterns, and could result in up to 7% decrease in delay. On the other hand, using information from connected vehicles to better adapt the traffic signal has proven to be indeed very valuable. Increases in the penetration rate from 0% up to 60% can significantly reduce the average delay (in low demand scenarios a decrease in delay of up to 60% can be observed). That being said, after a penetration rate of 60%, while the delays continue to decrease, the rate of reduction decreases and the marginal value of information from communication technologies diminishes. Overall, it is observed that connected vehicle technology could significantly improve the operation of traffic at signalized intersections, at least under the proposed algorithm. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

    "[228,0,0,\"Lane change is one of the most common maneuvers in traffic and at least 60, 000 people are injured from them. This problem is usually addressed from the perspective of automation and for a single vehicle using path planning and control approaches. However, traffic is a multi-agent system which can use communication technologies to perform coordinated maneuvers in a decentralized manner. This paper aims to present a Decentralized Bargaining Negotiation Process allowing that two conflicting agents negotiate. During the negotiation, agents calculate velocity change proposals and communicate with each other in order to solve the conflict at the lowest cost. This enables that agents open safe distance gaps and make the maneuvers. We also proposed a cost function attenuation so that the agents can continue to negotiate while the agreement was not reached, but with less impact on the cost. We simulated lane merge task on SUMO with a two-lane highway with speed limit of 30 m/s. We initially simulated 2 agents and we were increasing the number of agents up to 26. We recorded the total average time for the platoon to perform the lane merge task, the platoon average velocity and the average of the speed limit exceeded in each simulation. By increasing the number of agents the total average time stabilized approximately 25 seconds. Which represents an expressive result because the time for one vehicle to complete the maneuver is 4.6 seconds. The average speed was also approximately constant around 22 m/s, which represents a good result for the traffic flow. The highest speed exceeded 9 % which represents 2.70 m/s with the attenuation cost function.

While this may be appropriate on highways, linear predictions do not work properly on curved roads or lane crossings. This contribution introduces a generic way for including environmental knowledge - such as the lane trajectory ahead - to anticipate yaw rate and acceleration of other traffic participants. The anticipatory knowledge is used to improve prediction in filtering tasks. It is embedded in a Bayesian framework by introducing attractors, which modify the probabilistic propagation of state estimations. The attractors model how traffic participants typically behave, given environmental knowledge such as lane information, traffic lights, or indicator lights. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by modeling the fact that vehicles usually stay in their lane. We show that given correct context information and nonlinear traffic situations, the tracking error is considerably lower compared to conventional tracking methods. In addition, we also show that the intentions of other traffic participants may be inferred by comparing actual sensory data with anticipated probability distributions, which were generated dependent on alternative attractors. © 2012 IEEE.\"],\n",

Results: Of the 4,000 vehicles sampled using the SDR cell phone detection device, 6.1% of the a.m. peak travel time and 7.6% of the p.m. peak travel time had an active cellular device. A concurrent visual field verification of driver cell phone use showed that approximately 57% (a.m. peak) and 67% (p.m. peak) of the SDR-detected cell phones were visually confirmed to be associated with distracted cell phone use. Conclusions: Once characterized, the frequency of driver cell phone use can be used to justify changes to signal timing protocols. These adjustments could include extending the signal’s “all-red time” or holding “yellow time” longer in order to properly clear the intersection. These data can also be used to identify locations that may require more enforcement measures to dissuade driver cell phone use. Furthermore, the impact of anti–cell phone campaigns or new laws can be quantified by measuring before and after cell phone use in the near term rather than waiting for crash studies at intersections to be completed and analyzed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"],\n",

However, in urban environments, blocking of satellite signals would affect signal reception and lead to cycle slips frequent occurrence on carrier phase. Because TDCP could be affected by cycle slip easily, cycle slip detection and correction work need to be done. High-order difference cycle slip detection method is considered to have advantages, eliminating outliers simply and effectively. However, there would be misjudgement for cycle slip when vehicle is in motion if a constant threshold is adopted. Thus, this paper proposes a kinematic characteristics separation algorithm from observation to provide an adaptive detection threshold for high-order difference method, which adjusts cycle slip identification to dynamic situation of vehicles with high reliability. Validity of the algorithm are verified by road tests.

Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly.

To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel semantic-elevation mapping approach for navigation task. We first build a multi-layer semantic map from continuous semantic segmentation images. Then, this multi-layer semantic map is fused and converted into a probabilistic map by a distance transform approach. Generated semantic probabilistic map is then fused to an elevation map at path planning stage. The proposed approach is tested on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform. The results show that our semantic-elevation mapping approach works more reliably and safely than that only with elevation-based approach. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

With the diversification of UAV environment, it is very important to find a collision-free path in complex environment. Traditional path planning algorithms can find feasible paths, but they do not have a good balance between time efficiency and path length. Traditional geometric algorithms can only avoid obstacles with special shapes. In this paper, an improved geometric path planning algorithm is proposed, which can make UAV avoid obstacles of arbitrary shape in complex environment and find shorter paths. First, for irregular obstacles, a convex polygon model is established. Then, the heuristic method is used to select the path segment, which solves the disadvantage of traditional geometric algorithm falling into local optimal solution. And the idea of quadratic programming is proposed to generate collision-free paths from adjacent paths, and a new security threshold strategy is proposed for this method.

The main target is to plan the motion of a group of vehicles to achieve a specific pattern predefined by the user. The multi-layer is divided into two tasks. The first task is to plan the vehicle configuration using the traditional Q-learning algorithm due to the low computational time and the cost in terms of consumption of computing resources.

    "[295,0,0,\"Research on dynamic path planning for autonomous vehicle has been increased significantly in recent years because of the percentage of car accidents reduced by autonomous driving. The functions of Artificial Potential Fields (APF) as mentioned in previous studies, particularly nonlinear constraint, speed and safe distance, are seldom discussed or mentioned. In this paper, we focus on the need for vehicle safety. Thus, this study proposes a fuzzy artificial potential field path planning algorithm (FZ-APF) for local path planning in vehicle. FZ-APF introduces the distance factor to solve the well-known drawbacks of the traditional APF like goal non-reachable with obstacle nearby (GNRON) problem. However, FZ-APF not only optimizes path but also deals with the constraints of vehicle like the limit of steering angle at different speeds. Therefore, FZ-APF introduces longitudinal potential function to make the planned path accord with vehicle characteristics. In addition, to achieve more safe and efficient FZ-APF for vehicle, the fuzzy technique which adjusts the parameters at any moment according to the current speed and safety distance of the vehicle is added into FZ-APF. Numerical simulations are presented and validate the proposed algorithm under some complicated test scenarios. Experiment eventually illustrates the efficiency of this FZ-APF algorithm using an autonomous vehicle prototype. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\"],\n",

One such problem is the communications between the network of AUVs and the human operators. In this paper, we strive to explore one of the steps taken in order to develop a novel solution to this particular problem. When a AUV is deployed for a high endurance mission, having it resurface periodically can be a time consuming and hazardous proposition. In one hand there is the need to protect and maintain the mission, while in the other there is the need for the human operator to receive and assimilate data mid-mission. The Flying Modem is a UAV with water-landing capabilities, that also carries an acoustic modem, effectively becoming a mobile, acoustic to Wi-Fi relay point in the mission network. It allows the AUV to communicate with it and then have the UAV relay the data to base.

    "[297,0,0,\"Road pavements are structures with finite lives. They are designed to withstand a specific number of Equivalent Single Axle Loads (ESALs). Consequently, the truck traffic consumption of ESAL design life, and increased road infrastructure costs associated with it, can increase rapidly where significant volumes of truck traffic is involved. During the construction of major infrastructure or other objects it is usually necessary to shift large amounts of material from one location to another. The individual works causes higher traffic on the main and regional roads with construction site vehicles, usually within a specified, short period of time, causing more damage and more rapid deterioration of these roads, which are not dimensioned to facilitate that kind of traffic load. Maintenance and restoration of these roads are therefore very high and usually not provided for in planning documents. The solution to the problem concerns the sharing of costs for reinforcement or repairs of roads between all parties; owner of the road, investor of the construction and/or operators of these works. For this purpose a methodology was developed to determine the necessary corrective measures in the main and regional roads, where increased volume of truck traffic due to construction of certain infrastructures is calculated against the normal volume of the trucks on a measured road section.

    "[299,0,0,\"Robust motion planning is a complicated NP-hard problem that is considered as an essential characteristic of autonomy. This multi-objective problem considers the environmental disturbances and the possibilities for vehicles deployment during a mission. Although the recent advancements in embedded processors and sensor technology have opened new opportunities in underwater motion planning and facilitated AUVs to handle long-range operations, the inaccuracy of existing knowledge on uncertain spatiotemporal environment extends the complexity of motion planning problem. The class of underwater vehicles still have major challenges in dealing with uncertain ocean current variability that can strongly affect their motion, battery usage and mission duration. Current variations can also drift moving objects across the vehicle’s trajectory; therefore, the planned path may turn to be invalid or inefficient. Another challenge is that having a precise estimation of the behaviour of such an uncertain/dynamic environment in long-range operations, outside the vehicle’s sensor coverage, is usually unreliable and impractical. The robustness of a vehicle’s path planning to this strong environment variability is a crucial consideration in vehicle’s safety and mission performance. No polynomial time algorithm exists to solve an NP-hard problem of even moderate size. On the other hand, obtaining an absolute optimum solution is only applicable in fully known and certain environments. The modelled underwater environment in this chapter corresponds to a highly dynamic uncertain environment. To address the challenges associated with the path planning across a dynamic large-scale geographical area, which has been discussed precisely in Chaps. 3 and 4, this chapter aims to develop an online real-time motion planning strategy that enhances a vehicle’s ability to cope with variations of surroundings and render a reliable trajectory for vehicle’s transmission.

The tradition subsea detection methods, such as hydroacoustic and visual methods, are excluded from the subsea cable detection and localization due to the applicability of detection for large-sized and exposed subsea pipelines.

This study proposes an optimized complete path planning method that enables an autonomous tractor located on the entrance to automatically go to the starting location of an operational path, perform an agricultural task within the field boundary, and return to the exit with minimum travel distance. An operational path was optimally generated by minimizing the total travel distances determined by various driving angles.

Road vehicles capable of operating independently of real-time human control under an increasing set of circumstances will likely become more widely available in the near future. Such vehicles are expected to bring a variety of benefits. Two such anticipated advantages (relative to human-driver vehicle control) are said to be increased road network capacity and the freeing up of the driver-occupant's time to engage in their choice of leisurely or economically-productive (non-driving) tasks.In this study we investigate the implications for intersection capacity and level-of-service of providing occupants of automated (without real-time human control), autonomously-operating (without vehicle-to-X communication) cars with ride quality that is equivalent (in terms of maximum rates of longitudinal and lateral acceleration) to two types of rail systems: [urban] light rail transit and [inter-urban] high-speed rail. The literature suggests that car passengers start experiencing discomfort at lower rates of acceleration than car drivers; it is therefore plausible that occupants of an autonomously-operating vehicle may wish to instruct their vehicle to maneuver in a way that provides them greater ride comfort than if the vehicle-control algorithm simply mimicked human-driving-operation.On the basis of traffic microsimulation analysis, we found that restricting the dynamics of autonomous cars to the acceleration/deceleration characteristics of both rail systems leads to reductions in a signalized intersection's vehicle-processing capacity and increases in delay. The impacts were found to be larger when constraining the autonomous cars' dynamics to the more-restrictive acceleration/deceleration profile of high-speed rail. The scenarios we analyzed must be viewed as boundary conditions, because autonomous cars' dynamics were by definition never allowed to exceed the acceleration/deceleration constraints of the rail systems. Appropriate evidence regarding motorists' preferences does not exist at present; establishing these preferences is an important item for the future research agenda.This paper concludes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"],\n",

The procedure ends when the iteration limit is reached or fitness criterium is met. In the presented autonomous UAV 3D path planning method, a PSO algorithm is used to build a feasible path, optimized in terms of fuel and threat cost. The process begins when the UAV detects or receives information about threats appearing on its primary trajectory.

These angles determine the spatial orientation of the UAV, indicating its direction of movement in each step. Further waypoints are chosen with consideration of the distance to the target and violation of threat areas. As a final result, the PSO algorithm constructs a suboptimal, feasible path which could be used as a reference trajectory for the UAV's automatic control system.

A method of planning the trajectory of motion of a flying complex to the source of combustion, and modeling its modes of motion associated with the early detection of sources of combustion based on the space sensing and determining the concentration of CO, are proposed. Flight algorithms to the source of combustion have been developed, combining both motions along straight lines and circles, as well as joint interaction of a group of robots, realizing the calculation of control voltages during the movement of a robotic platform depending on the deviation from a given trajectory. The regularities of the guided motion controlled by various methods along a given s-shaped trajectory are revealed; the analysis of the latter showed that fuzzy control under the signal of an optocoupler matrix in comparison with the 'deterministic' control in response to a signal of an optocoupler provides an increase in the quality of motion by the criterion 'action speed-accuracy'. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[320,0,0,\"The automation of road transportation is one of the most important fields of research for today's vehicle industry. One of the key aspects for automated driving is the planning of safe, dynamically feasible, comfortable and customizable trajectories. Over the last decade, numerous different methods have been developed to solve the motion planning problem. However, many of these methods deal with only a very simplified - if any - model of vehicle dynamics. On one hand, the formulation of the trajectory planning problem in case of geometric, graph search or sampling based algorithms makes the consideration of the dynamic equations of vehicle motion very difficult. On the other hand, nonlinear optimization based algorithms can deal with even complex models of nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, but this goes at the expense of computational requirements, which endangers real-time applicability. This paper presents a method which is capable of the evaluation of trajectories planned by an arbitrary motion planning algorithm in sense of dynamical feasibility. A metrics is developed to qualify the trajectories in terms of their traceability for the vehicle under given working conditions. Based on the defined metrics, a threshold is developed to decide about the applicability of the trajectory. It is shown that the presented method is computationally much less demanding as an optimization-based motion planning algorithm, and can still be used to verify that the vehicle can drive on the planned trajectory even if the dynamics was not considered at the time of planning at all. The performance of the algorithm is examined with the help of computer simulations, and includes the consideration of real-time applicability. At the end of the paper, conclusions are summarized and possible future research directions are taken into account related to the presented topic. © 2019 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

    "[322,0,0,\"The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been implemented in various fields, such as to monitor deep and long-distance sea conditions, underwater mapping, long time surveys, neutralization of seabed mines, and military applications. In the military field, one of the AUV applications is a torpedo. A torpedo has a mission to go to a given target, frequently a moving target. To meet this objective, the torpedo must have a detection system to find out the target position. However, it is impossible to be implemented because of the limited space and energy available in a torpedo. Therefore, it requires a reliable system to predict a moving target, to form the path to hit the target, avoid obstacles in the path, and the controller that can follow the path determined by the path planning algorithm. Therefore, this study developed various scenarios to simulate the conditions. The results show that the radial base function network can form a path that is free from obstacles and able to form a path that can intercept a moving target while the state-dependent LQT algorithm is able to perform a path tracking properly so that the AUV can reach a predetermined target. With the speed of 1.4 m/s, the AUV could intercept a moving target with the speed of 0.2 m/s and the face angle of -1.7 radians at t = 75.1 seconds. In another scenario, the AUV intercepted a moving target with the speed of 0.5 m/s and the face angle of -1.18 radians at t = 73.2 seconds. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[330,0,0,\"The exploration of unknown areas has been accelerated by the development of consumer grade UAVs. Sensors and sensing systems have also become commodity items that researchers and developers can use to gain an understanding of the composition and concentrations of nutrients, moisture, and pollutants in soil, water, and air. A large unknown field of interest (a target field) can be explored to a high degree of accuracy if the entire field could be scanned using any of the various autonomous exploration system. This may not be possible if the field is very large and the exploration vehicle has limited exploration time due to terrain restrictions, battery/fuel limitations, and/or sensing capabilities. If the quantity of interest being predicted in a target field exhibits a degree of spatial autocorrelation, then estimates can be made at all points in the field based on observations taken at a few selected points. This paper explores where an exploration vehicle should travel to collect samples that create minimum variance estimates of all points in the field. It does this by determining the spatial autocorrelation of the estimated quantity, and uses this information to determine the next portion of the path that minimizes the sum of the variances of every point in the field. The Kriging Method, a Best Linear Unbiased Predictor, generates a prediction, and variance of that prediction, of a single point in a target field given a set of observed points. Averaging the estimation variances across all points in the field provides an objective function to guide path planning. The goal of each of the planners introduced is to assist in the discovery of a field's features with an adjustable trade-off between arc length of the total path traveled and confidence of field prediction. Each of the path planners introduced attempts to reduce Kriging prediction variance by steering an exploration vehicle through a target field in a fashion that is predicted to reduce overall field uncertainty. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.\"],\n",
    "[331,1,1,\"The future air traffic management (ATM) concept envisaged by the Single European Sky ATM Research - SESAR - and the USA equivalent NextGen, mark a paradigm shift from the current reactive approach of ATM towards holistic strategic collaborative decision making. The core of the future ATM concept relies on common situational awareness over potentially large time-horizons, based upon the user operational intent. This is beyond human capabilities and requires the support of automation tools to predict aircraft state throughout the operation and provide support to optimal decision making long before any potential conflict may arise. This is achieved with trajectory predictors and conflict detectors and resolvers respectively. Numerous tools have been developed, typically geared towards addressing specific airborne applications. However, a comprehensive literature search suggests that none of the tools was designed to predict trajectories throughout the entire operation of an aircraft, i.e. gate-to-gate. Yet, such functionality is relevant in the holistic optimisation of aircraft operations. To address this gap, this paper builds on an existing en route trajectory prediction (TP) model and develops novel techniques to predict aircraft trajectories for the transitions between the ground- and enroute-phases of operation and for the ground-phase, thereby enabling gate-to-gate (or enroute-to-enroute) TP. The model is developed on the basis of Newtonian physics and operational procedures. Real recorded data obtained from a flight data record (FDR) were used to estimate some of the input parameters required by the model. The remaining parameters were taken from the BADA 3.7 model. Performance results using these flight data demonstrate that the proposed TP model has the potential to accurately predict gate-togate trajectories and to support future ATM applications such as gate-to-gate synchronisation. © 2015 The Aeronautical Journal.\"],\n",

    "[333,0,0,\"The growing interest in robust motion planning under safety constraints for robotic systems, such as autonomous vehicles or collaborative robots, lead to an increased interest to prove the stability or stabilizability of dynamic models of such systems. The proofs are usually based on Lyapunov theory and often rely on 'funnels', tubes or similar invariants that bound variations along reference trajectories. Recent methods have shown how to compute such funnels via sum-of-square (SoS) optimization. In this work we propose a new approach to solve this problem relying on optimal control based state-space partitioning and relaxation techniques for polynomial programming. In contrast to SoS techniques, our approach is inherently suitable to supply certificates of local stability and deal with bounded control inputs without increasing the complexity of the arising optimization problem. We present how to use our approach to obtain a large inner approximation of the true region of attraction around a given trajectory for which it is ensured that all states inside the funnel will reach goal states in a given time period. This property makes it interesting to integrate our approach in a general path or task planning algorithm.

However, traffic jams on urban highway bridges occur with high probability, and the inertial effect of passing vehicles due to earthquakes thus could not be negligible in the context of seismic design of bridges when vehicle’s weight is large enough compared with the dead load of bridges. It is therefore of engineers’ interest to conduct a seismic analysis of bridges considering the vehicle dynamics effect on the seismic behavior of the bridge. Earthquakes occur unexpectedly and recently more and more strong motions were recorded, which are important for seismic engineering.

Observations showed that, compared with those of disregarding vehicles, VBI changed the bridge displacement responses, plastic deformations, relative displacements of bearings and acceleration responses of the bridge but to different tendency and degree under different ground motions.

Thirdly, at the end of path, double cubic Bezier curve is used to generate feasible path into the parking slot. At last, automatic parking experiment is carried out on the micro-vehicle-based hardware simulation system, and the experimental result verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[353,0,0,\"The popularization of electric vehicles has a close relationship with the construction of charging infrastructure. However, the fixed charging stations are not flexible enough for their limited number and distribution. To promote the mobile charging as supplementary, a planning method of mobile charging for electric vehicles is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the roads are described as a series of nodes with certain topology. Then, the planning based on ant colony algorithm is conducted. For the simultaneous charging requests from multiple uses, the optimal charging point is determined and the paths for electric vehicles are provided. Finally, the mobile charging is simulated by taking the roads around Tianfu Square in Chengdu as an example, and the simulation result is visualized on an application developed on Android platform. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"],\n",
    "[354,1,1,\"The present paper demonstrates a feasible real-time path planning algorithm and tracking method for autonomous driving vehicles based on a 5 th-order Bézier curve. It is demonstrated that a 5 th-degree Bézier curve is required to generate a feasible path to achieve lane change maneuvers in a dynamic on-road environment. The steering rate control input is calculated based on the curvature extracted from the generated trajectory. Matlab simulations were conducted both for path generation and instantaneous planning of driving path for single and double lane change maneuvers. The proposed method was evaluated in an experiment using a miniature-sized unmanned ground vehicle. © 2013 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[355,0,0,\"The present paper demonstrates the use of exact equations to predict time-optimal mission plans for a marine vehicle that visits a number of locations in a given dynamic ocean current field. This problem bears close resemblance to that of the classic 'traveling salesman', albeit with the added complexity that the vehicle experiences a dynamic flow field while traversing the paths. The paths, or 'legs', between all goal waypoints are generated by numerically solving the exact time-optimal path planning level-set differential equations. Overall, the planning proceeds in four steps. First, current forecasts for the planning horizon is obtained utilizing our data-driven 4D primitive equation ocean modeling system (Multidisciplinary Simulation Estimation and Assimilation System; MSEAS), forced by high-resolution tidal and real-time atmopsheric forcing fields. Second, all tour permutations are enumerated and the minimum number of times the time-optimal PDEs are to be solved is established. Third, due to the spatial and temporal dynamics, a varying start time results in different paths and durations for each leg and requires all permutations of travel to be calculated. To do so, the minimum required time-optimal PDEs are solved and the optimal travel time is computed for each leg of all enumerated tours. Finally, the tour permutation for which travel time is minimized is identified and the corresponding time-optimal paths are computed by solving the backtracking equation. Even though the method is very efficient and the optimal path can be computed serially in real-time for common naval operations, for additional computational speed, a high-performance computing cluster was used to solve the level set calculations in parallel. Our equation and software is applied to simulations of realistic naval applications in the complex Philippines Archipelago region. Our method calculates the global optimum and can serve two purposes: (a) it can be used in its present form to plan multi-waypoint missions offline in conjunction with a predictive ocean current modeling system, or (b) it can be used as a litmus test for approximate future solutions to the traveling salesman problem in dynamic flow fields. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[356,0,0,\"The primary purpose of path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is a necessary prerequisite toward an autonomous UAV, is to guide the robot to the predefined target while the chosen path is optimized. This paper addresses the problem of path planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle in a 2D indoor environment, considering motion uncertainty. To cope with this challenge, the problem of motion planning is formulated in three parts. A vision-based extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to localize the UAV in the unstructured environment. To overcome motion uncertainty, the problem is modeled as a Markov decision problem (MDP). Finally, a novel dynamic feedback linearization based switching controller is proposed for point-to-point motion. Simulation and experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed path planning method in practice. © 2019 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[385,0,0,\"The purpose of this paper is to present a new path-planning algorithm for planetary exploration rovers that will guide the vehicle safely to a reachable state. In particular, this work will make use of a special class of artificial potential functions called navigation functions which are guaranteed to be free of local minimum. The construction of the navigation functions in this work is motivated by the grid-based wavefront expansion method but differs in that the contour levels are defined in terms of the control effort of the system. Two new methods will be introduced in this paper for defining the navigation function. The first method will generate a minimum control effort path plan and the second method will be based on an inverse dynamics approach. Each of the control effort based methods will generate a path plan that will guide the rover’s approach towards an objective reachable state.

This has also led to development of numerous rapid prototyping platforms and techniques which allow us to test various path planning algorithms and control methods. In this paper a novel and modular experimental setup to perform localisation, obstacle detection and path planning for an Ackermann steering robot using only a single RGB camera and a LIDAR sensor has been presented. The RGB camera is mounted on the ceiling facing directly towards the ground and connected to an external laptop. For localisation, a uniquely shaped marker placed on the robot is used to find the position and the orientation of the robot in the video stream coming from the camera. This is done using color filtering followed by blob detection. The mobile robot has a LIDAR sensor and an on-board computer which is used to transfer the LIDAR data through a wireless network to the external laptop using TCP/IP protocol. The obstacle data from the robot is enhanced using potential field and combined with the position data from the overhead camera to construct a cost-map which is a detailed representation of the position of the robot and all the obstacles around it. The cost-map is used to find a path around the obstacles to reach the destination depending upon the starting position and orientation. This setup was tested using four different types of search algorithms namely Uniform Cost Search, A-star(A?), Dynamic Programming(DP) and Hybrid A? and the results have been reported. The results verify the superiority of Hybrid A? over other algorithms. An optimization technique called gradient descent is used to smooth out the path obtained. © 2017 IEEE.\"],\n",

This requires that autonomous systems correctly estimate the current traffic scene and its likely evolution. In highway scenarios early recognition of cut-in maneuvers is essential for risk-aware maneuver planning. In this paper, a statistical approach is proposed, which advantageously utilizes a set of prototypical lane change trajectories to realize both early maneuver detection and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction for traffic participants. Generation of prototype trajectories from real traffic data is accomplished by Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. During clustering, the alignment of the cluster prototypes to each other is optimized and the cohesion of the resulting prototype is limited when two clusters merge. In the prediction stage, the similarity of observed vehicle motion and typical lane change patterns in the data base is evaluated to construct a set of significant features for maneuver classification via Boosted Decision Trees. The future trajectory is predicted combining typical lane change realizations in a mixture model. B-splines based trajectory adaptations guarantee continuity during transition from actually observed to predicted vehicle states.

    "[427,0,0,\"This paper describes a decoupled sampling-based motion-planning method, based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) approach, that is applicable to autonomous vehicles, in order to perform different traffic maneuvers. This is a two-step motion-planning method including path-planning and motion timing steps, where both steps are sampling-based. In the path-planning part, an improved RRT method is defined that increases the smoothness of the path and decreases the computational time of the RRT method; it is called smooth RRT, SRRT. While some other RRT-based methods such as RRT can perform better in winding roads, in the problem of interest in this paper (which is performing some regular traffic maneuvers in usual urban roads and highways where the passage is not too winding), SRRT is more efficient since the computational time is less than for the other considered methods. In the motion timing or velocity-tuning step (VTS), a sampling-based method is introduced that guarantees collision avoidance between different vehicles. The proposed motiontiming algorithm can be very useful for collision avoidance and can be used with any other path-planning method. Simulation results show that because of the probabilistic property of the SRRT and VTS algorithms, together with the decoupling feature of the method, the algorithm works well for different traffic maneuvers. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",

The proposed algorithm is composed of the four steps: 1) target motion prediction; 2) drivable area decision 3) local path planning and 4) vehicle control. The target motion prediction is crucial parts for realizing autonomous valet parking system because many vehicles which search available parking lot exist simultaneously. To predict future motion of target, the intention of the target should be inferred first. Interacting multiple model (IMM) filter using two models has been used to infer the intention of the target. Based on the inferred intention, most appropriate model's results are used as a predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. After that, the drivable area is decided to avoid collision with static obstacles and moving targets using potential filed approach to assessment the risk. In this stage, pre-defined parking lot map which contains boundary of the parking lots and waypoints is used to define initial guess of the drivable area. Inside the drivable area, rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) generate the desired local path while guaranteeing the real-time performance in dynamic environments. Finally, path tracking controller and speed controller calculate desired steering wheel and longitudinal acceleration input.

Tiji is geared towards complex dynamic systems subject to differential constraints, such as wheeled vehicles, and its efficiency warrants it can be used in real-time. Above all, Tiji is able to compute a trajectory that reaches the goal state at a prescribed final time in order to avoid collision with the moving objects of the environment. The method proposed, which relies upon a parametric trajectory representation, is variational in nature. The trajectory parameters are incrementally updated in order to optimize of a cost function involving the distance between the end of the trajectory computed and the (goal state, final time) pair.

    "[472,1,1,\"This paper presents a generic approach for tactical decision-making under uncertainty in the context of driving. The complexity of this task mainly stems from the fact that rational decision-making in this context must consider several sources of uncertainty: The temporal evolution of situations cannot be predicted without uncertainty because other road users behave stochastically and their goals and plans cannot be measured. Even more important, road users are only able to perceive a tiny part of the current situation with their sensors because measurements are noisy and most of the environment is occluded. In order to anticipate the consequences of decisions a probabilistic approach, considering both forms of uncertainty, is necessary. We address this by formulating the task of driving as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be automatically optimized for different scenarios. As driving is a continuous-space problem, the belief space is infinite-dimensional. We do not use a symbolic representation or discretize the state space a priori because there is no representation of the state space that is optimal for every situation. Instead, we employ a continuous POMDP solver that learns a good representation of the specific situation. © 2014 IEEE.\"],\n",

    "[479,0,0,\"This paper presents a novel adaptive cruise control (ACC) strategy that utilizes a command governor (CG) to enforce vehicle following constraints. The CG formulation relies on knowledge of the maximum possible braking deceleration of the lead vehicle and a tunable assumption regarding the lead vehicle velocity profile (offering different levels of conservatism) to modify wheel torque commands to ensure safe following. In particular, a safe following distance is defined as one in which the ego vehicle can avoid collision with the lead vehicle and maintain a sufficient following distance in the event that the lead vehicle exerts maximum braking deceleration. The CG seeks to adjust the wheel torque command such that the aforementioned constraint is satisfied at every step in a prediction horizon (i.e., at every step, if the lead vehicle exerts maximum braking deceleration, the ego vehicle can brake and remain outside of the aforementioned buffer zone), which requires an estimate of future lead vehicle behavior. In this work, we explore different levels of conservatism with regard to this assumption. Simulations are presented for a heavyduty truck, using a stochastic lead vehicle model that has been calibrated with actual traffic data. Even for the most conservative lead vehicle prediction models, results show that this CGbased ACC strategy can reduce braking energy expended (used as a surrogate for fuel wasted) by up to 78%, while improving drivability and reducing total trip time. © 2019 ASME.\"],\n",

To predict future parking parameters, we proposed a practical framework which integrates anticipatory techniques with a model predictive approach that robustly models the stochastic parking environment. The framework is able to take into account the interactions between vehicle subsystems, and can optimize trajectory under complex traffic patterns in real-world scenarios. Adaptive model predictive control is utilized to optimally minimize a cost function regarding performance, energy efficiency and drivability with regard to surrounding vehicle states. Dynamic programming was used to solve the control objective under multiple constraints, which yielded superior performance in comparison with convex programming. An original navigation system was developed for leading user to the parking spot in case of forgetting exact location, which is characterized in that swift location and path are generated by BLE-based sensor fusion. After successful parking action, the system beacons the parking location and transmits data to mobile equipment of user, which serves as goal of searching task.

Instead of certain forms of spline, simple line segments are directly used to form the path. Initially, a very raw path is generated consisting of several rough line segments in sequence. The initial path represents a rough guess that lies close to the optimal solution with relatively high possibility. Therefore, subsequent search shrinks its sample space to the neighborhood of the generated path to produce a finer path comprising shorter line segments.

To solve this problem, an alternative solution of integrating the aerial images captured by the image sensor of a flying quadrotor and the global positioning system (GPS), electrical compass, and height sensor data is proposed to provide real-time images in the global coordinate instead of satellite images. Naturally, aerial images possess higher resolution pixels than the satellite images and allow real-time modifications of geographic information.

    "[535,0,0,\"Traffic loading is one of the most critical inputs in the pavement design process. Load characterization includes the magnitude and the number of load repetit ions for each axle configuration. Historically, procedures for axle load characterization in pavement design include: (a) fixed traffic load, (b) fixed vehicle/axle, and (c) variable traffic and vehicle/axle. Generally, the first procedure is adopted for airport pavements, the latter both characterizations are used for the design of highway pavements. In a fixed vehicle/axle procedure, the thickness design is based on the number of repetitions of a standard vehicle or axle load, usually the 18-kip single axle load for highway pavements. If the axle load is different from 18-kip or consists of tandem or tridem axles, it is converted to 18-kip single axle repetitions by a load equivalency factor (LEF). Finally, for variable traffic and vehicle/axle, both axles and their repetitions are considered separately and required axle load spectra (ALS) for different axle types. The concept of equivalent single axle load (ESAL) was developed in AASHTO design guide while mechanistic-empirical design method (Pavement-ME) uses ALS to characterize axle loadings and repetitions. The primary objective of the paper is to evaluate the effects of different load characterizations (ESAL versus ALS) on flexible pavement performance. The approach includes analysis of a standard flexible pavement section by using the axle load spectra from 41 weigh-inmotion (WIM) stations across Michigan. The ESALs were estimated from the ALS for all the WIM stations. Subsequently, the traffic load and repetitions were modeled as ESALs in the Pavement-ME. Flexible pavement performance (fatigue cracking, rutting, and IRI) was predicted by using the site-specific ALS and ESALs. Pavement damage and performance measures were compared between ALS and ESALs to establish the impact of load characterization on the flexible pavement performance.

However, in real-world applications, the limitations of on-board resources (e.g., power supply) of UAVs will constrain the coverage of the monitored area and the number of the acquired samples, which will hinder the performance of field estimation and mapping. Therefore, the issue of constrained resources calls for an efficient sampling planner to schedule UAV-based sensing tasks in environmental monitoring. This paper presents a mission planner of coverage sampling and path planning for a UAV-enabled mobile sensor to effectively explore and map an unknown environment that is modeled as a random field. The proposed planner can generate a coverage path with an optimal coverage density for exploratory sampling, and the associated energy cost is subjected to a power supply constraint. The performance of the developed framework is evaluated and compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, using a real-world dataset that is collected from an environmental monitoring program as well as physical field experiments.

In recent years, disasters such as flooding are having increasingly damaging societal and environmental effects.

However, the limited battery life of small lightweight UAVs imposes efficient strategies to subsample the sensing field in this context. This paper proposes a novel solution to maximise the number of inspected flooded surface while keeping the travelled distance bounded. Our proposal solves the so-called continuous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the costs of travelling from one location to another depend not only on the distance, but also on the presence of water. To determine the optimal path between checkpoints, we employ the fast sweeping algorithm using a cost function defined from hyperspectral satellite maps identifying flooded regions. Preliminary results using MODIS flood maps show that our UAV planning strategy achieves a covered flooded surface approximately 3.33 times greater for the same travelled distance when compared to the conventional TSP solution.

    "[555,0,0,\"Unmanned aircraft typically rely on radio frequency (RF) links for at least command and control (C2) and navigation, and may also employ RF links for other critical functions, such as position reporting through ADS-B or mode C transponders. Vehicles used in future On Demand Mobility (ODM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations, whether flown with no onboard operator or with a minimally trained onboard operator, are expected to be similarly dependent on RF links for navigation, control, and communication with Air Traffic Control (ATC) (whether by a human or an automated system). Loss of even one of these links can present a significant hazard. For example, recent UAS accidents have often involved lost communication links. As the level of autonomy of UAS increases, loss of C2 links may not be directly catastrophic though it is still likely to be disruptive to airspace operations, and other RF links, particularly satellite navigation links, become essential for maintaining safe vehicle operations. The challenges of maintaining RF links will grow as operations of highly autonomous vehicles expand, and as envisioned future concepts of operation become a reality. Future aviation systems such as UAS operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and air taxis operating as part of an envisioned UAM system will frequently operate at low altitudes far from established airports. At these low altitudes, terrain, buildings, and even vegetation can significantly impact RF coverage.

When an emergency vehicle – such as a fire truck or an ambulance – is approaching, self-driving cars are required to modify their path plan and find a safe spot rapidly. However early detection of a fast approaching emergency vehicle in urban environment is challenging with a visual perception system since it requires direct view without an obstacle in between. To improve the safety of self-driving cars, a localization algorithm is required to maximize the path modification time constraint as well as to minimize location and direction detection time, especially at an intersection in urban environments.

Limited shoreline verification is restricted to the navigable area (typically seaward of the 4 meter contour). In this area, surveyors confirm or disprove the presence of features, where a feature can be any anthropogenic or natural object that may merit individual cartographic representation (e.g., rocks, wrecks,obstructions), identify and position features not detected using aircraft or satellite based photogrammetry, and obtain heights on significant features. Currently, NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations field units utilize hydrographic survey launches or skiffs with personnel on board to get close enough to shoreline features to obtain a position, an activity that is generally inefficient and inherently dangerous. Other technologies have been applied to this task with differing degrees of success. Examples include airborne lidar, vessel mounted, side-looking lidar, and satellite based bathymetry. Each of these have each demonstrated certain advantages, but also come with operational and logistical constraints, environmental limitation, and mobilization cost. Advancements in Unmanned Aerial systems (UAS) and photogrammetric techniques, specifically structure from motion (SfM), make these platforms a tempting choice for this mission. The combination of relatively low vehicle and sensor cost, small platform size, and ease of operations may allow collection of high-resolution shoreline data from a safe distance,without ever having to put manned platforms in harm's way. Under this approach, the surveyor deploys an UAS with a mounted digital camera and flies pre-programmed flight paths to cover a survey area with overlapping aerial photographs. SfM processing of this imagery yields both 3D point clouds and an image mosaic. We report our success to date with this approach, including the substantial regulatory and administrative aspects of planning and executing these missions. While the regulatory aspects of unmanned aerial systems are rapidly evolving, we outline a reasonable and well-vetted approach for operators that has been successful for our work. We believe that demonstrating a consistent and pro-active commitment to safe operations and full compliance with environmental and regulatory aspects will be critical to the development of this technology. We share the operation risk management and best management practices developed so far. We also report on our data processing pipeline and findings from operations conducted in realistic field environments. Similar to other work in this field, we find proper image and environmental parameters are critical. Sun glint, cloud cover, and image quality are important. We also find waves (in particular breaking waves) cause difficulty in SfM processing, but interestingly, often convey important information about submerged features that are of particular interest. Where image processing to a SfM model is successful, we find positional accuracies are well within horizontal product specifications horizontally - even with inexpensive, consumer grade GNSS systems. Precise vertical control is more of a challenge. We report a tradeoff between establishing a network of ground control stations and establishing robust vehicle positioning through more advance methods such as post-processed kinematic PPK).

More specifically, focus is on derivation of relevant state equations in control input form, numerical and visual confirmation of state equation accuracy through specific simulations, and exploring interesting approaches to nonholonomic path planning with associated numerical simulation and visualization. Given the state equations (3rd order), in the interests of practical validation, they were exercised by considering motion on a number of smooth surfaces. The surfaces were selected for a variety of reasons, such as: the resulting qualitative trajectory is known a priori, there exists an opportunity to check numerical results with respect to previous results, or the surfaces are iconic and/or are geometrically rich. Nonholonomic steering on the surface is a very interesting and challenging problem and several approaches are investigated: (1) steering using sinusoids (detailed), (2) steering on a trajectory, and (3) “drive-and-turn” (valid in this case). Prior to implementing the steering using sinusoids algorithm, it was necessary to transform the system into “one-chained” form. The first step entailed conversion to an approximate one-chained form model that possesses a certain structure, from which the process established by Murray and Sastry can be successfully launched, where two special smooth scalar functions of the states are sought that possess special relationships to Lie-related distribution spaces associated with the control input vectors. Inputs are then transformed as well via specialized Lie derivatives. It was demonstrated through simulation that steering to an arbitrary system state on a faceted surface can be accomplished with sinusoidal inputs in only one maneuver set (i.e. maneuver A &amp; B). Using this fact, the work presented culminates with steering to an arbitrary system state on a smooth surface that can be accomplished by essentially iterating on a steering algorithm that assumes the particle is on a plane tangent to the smooth surface at the desired destination. In this regard, it is shown that a sequence of maneuver sets converges rather quickly in the example demonstrated.

Different models of iAA were developed, with beacon initialization (iAA-B), and with increased sensing ranges (iAA-R with a 2-step far-sightedness) to quantify the most effective one. Initial results with mazes of various sizes and complexity demonstrate our models are capable of localizing the target faster and more efficiently than other open searches reported in the literature, including those that utilized both AA and local path planning. The presented models can be implemented with self-organizing wireless sensor networks carried by autonomous drones or vehicles and can offer life-saving services of localizing victims of natural disasters or during major infrastructure failures. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"],\n",
    "[572,1,1,\"We describe a practical path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robots sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A * search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50-300 ms. © The Author(s), 2010.\"],\n",
    "[573,1,1,\"We discuss an implementation of the RRT* optimal motion planning algorithm for the half-car dynamical model to enable autonomous high-speed driving. To develop fast solutions of the associated local steering problem, we observe that the motion of a special point (namely, the front center of oscillation) can be modeled as a double integrator augmented with fictitious inputs. We first map the constraints on tire friction forces to constraints on these augmented inputs, which provides instantaneous, state-dependent bounds on the curvature of geometric paths feasibly traversable by the front center of oscillation. Next, we map the vehicle's actual inputs to the augmented inputs. The local steering problem for the half-car dynamical model can then be transformed to a simpler steering problem for the front center of oscillation, which we solve efficiently by first constructing a curvature-bounded geometric path and then imposing a suitable speed profile on this geometric path.

    "[580,1,1,\"We present an approach to the problem of differentially constrained mobile robot motion planning in arbitrary cost fields. The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., position, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection.

Existing mixed modes of transportation lacks spatiotemporal collaborative ability, which cannot work together to accomplish evacuation tasks in a safe and efficient way. It is of great scientific significance and application value for emergency response to adopt multimodal-transport evacuations and improve their spatial-temporal collaboration ability. However, multimodal-transport evacuation strategies for urban serious emergency event are great challenge to be solved. The reasons lie in that: (1) large-scale urban emergency environment are extremely complicated involving many geographical elements (e.g., road, buildings, over-pass, square, hydrographic net, etc.); (2) Evacuated objects are dynamic and hard to be predicted. (3) the distributions of pedestrians and vehicles are unknown. To such issues, this paper reveals both collaborative and competitive mechanisms of multimodal-transport, and further makes global optimal evacuation strategies from the macro-optimization perspective.

This paper is focusing on analysing a particular bridge geometry whereby aerodynamic coefficients were predicted by means of CFD. The accuracy of the numerical model was validated with the aid of experimental data from wind tunnel tests. Specifically, this work was conducted to investigate the effect of the wind barrier considering various wind flow angles and vehicle speeds. Mean forces and moments on the vehicle were analysed depending on both absolute and relative wind flows. The impact of performing relative motion between vehicle and bridge deck was investigated. Simulation results without wind barrier are qualitatively in good agreement with results found in literature. Nevertheless, the flow situation with wind barrier and relative motion is significantly more complex. Thus, CFD modelling has dominating advantages over wind tunnel tests in terms of both parameter variation and model accuracy. In this particular case CFD modelling is indeed essential in order to represent all possible wind flow angles and the relative motion between the vehicle and the bridge deck which remains difficult or rather hardly possible to perform in the wind tunnel. © 2019, Magdeburger Verein fur Technische Mechanik e.

    "[606,0,0,\"With the recent advancements in sensing and processing capabilities of consumer mobile devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.), they are becoming attractive choices for pervasive computing applications. Always-on monitoring of human movement patterns is one of those applications that has gained a lot of importance in the field of mobility and transportation research. Automatic detection of the current transportation mode (e.g., walking, biking, riding a shuttle, etc.) of a consumer using data from their smartphone sensors enables delivering of a number of customized services for multi-modal journey planning. Most accurate models for automatic mode detection are trained with supervised learning algorithms. In order to achieve high accuracy, the training datasets need to be sufficiently large, diverse, and correctly labeled. Specifically, the training data requires each type of mode data to be collected for a minimum duration that is necessary and sufficient for building high accuracy models. Collecting such data in an efficient manner is challenging because of the variability in the test subjects' multi-modal journey patterns, e.g., using mostly private vehicles for commute, not sufficiently using rideshares, etc. In this paper, we describe a Design of Experiment (DoE) to efficiently collect supervised training dataset from user smartphones in a controlled environment. In this DoE, we asked the subjects to use a data logger app during a multi-modal trip designed around the Ford Dearborn campus with the right trip characteristics. The app persistently logged GPS and motion sensor data in the background and sent it to a remote Hadoop server. Location data was used to detect movement and enhance the quality of the data collection in real-time, e.g., the app paused data logging when the user is detected to be waiting between two transit modes. © 2019 Ford Motor Company.

    "[607,1,1,\"Within a vehicle driving space, different entities such as vehicles and vulnerable road users are in constant interaction which governs their behaviour. Whilst smart sensors provide information about the state of the perceived objects, considering the spatio-temporal relationships between them with respect to the subject vehicle remains a challenge. This paper proposes to fill this gap by using contextual information to infer how perceived entities are expected to behave, and thus what are the consequences of these behaviours on the subject vehicle. For this purpose, an ontology is formulated about the vehicle, perceived entities and context (map information) to provide a conceptual description of all road entities with their interaction. It allows for inferences of knowledge about the situation of the subject vehicle with respect to the environment in which it is navigating. The framework is applied to the navigation of a vehicle as it approaches road intersections, to demonstrate its applicability. Results from the real-time implementation on a vehicle operating under controlled conditions are included. They show that the proposed ontology allows for a coherent understanding of the interactions between the perceived entities and contextual data. Further, it can be used to improve the situation awareness of an ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System), by determining which entities are the most relevant for the subject vehicle navigation. © 2014 IEEE.\"],\n",
    "[608,0,0,\"Within the context of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles this paper proposes methods for efficient encoding of motion primitives in neural networks on top of model-based and gradient-free reinforcement learning. It is distinguished between 5 core aspects: system model, network architecture, training algorithm, training tasks selection and hardware/software implementation. For the system model, a kinematic (3-states-2-controls) and a dynamic (16-states-2-controls) vehicle model are compared. For the network architecture, 3 feedforward structures are compared including weighted skip connections. For the training algorithm, virtual velocity constraints and network scheduling are proposed. For the training tasks, different feature vector selections are discussed. For the implementation, aspects of gradient-free learning using 1 GPU and the handling of perturbation noise therefore are discussed. The effects of proposed methods are illustrated in experiments encoding up to 14625 motion primitives. The capabilities of tiny neural networks with as few as 10 scalar parameters when scheduled on vehicle velocity are emphasized. © 2018 IEEE.\"],\n",
