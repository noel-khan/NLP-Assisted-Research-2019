    "[1  ,0,0,\"The ability to forecast a trend is very important in energy consumption prediction and energy production planning. The principle, under which the grey systems theory is applied in our energy consumption prediction, is that the forecasting system can be considered as a grey system. In such a system, unknown system's information can be determined by using known information. Here, the known information consists of energy consumption data, development trend in the consumption system. Based on our study, we eventually make forecast and decisions regarding possible future development. Our method is a whitenization process of a grey course. The model developed is based on the division method established for general data modelling and estimation of parameters of GM(1, 1) its standard error coefficient that was applied to judge the accuracy height of the model was put forward; further, the function transform to forecast energy consuming trend and assess GM(1, 1) parameter was established. These two models need not pre-process the primitive data. It was not only suited for equal interval data modeling, but also for non-equal interval data modeling. Its calculation was simple and used conveniently, and the oil consumption per unit output analysis was taken as an example. The example showed that the two models were simple and practical, it was worth expanding and applying in the energy consuming prediction and energy programming.\"],\n",

It is argued that the direct coupling of energy consumption with economic growth made the revision of energy forecasts politically difficult and placed them at the receiving end of the fallout from unrealistic economic expectations. It is suggested that the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is considerably more unpredictable, complex and idiosyngratic than the linear rule allows for. It is recommended that the rule be abandoned for a flexible and frequently reviewable system of formulating predictions on future energy demand fairly independently from economic growth forecasts that are based on the statistical trends at the time.\"],\n",

The development of electricity and fuel demand for the period from 1960 to 1976 is interpreted and analysed. Fuel consumption corresponding to production decreased continually with growing capacity utilization. By way of contrast the specific consumption of electric energy increased during the period.

The results show that affected by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 epidemic, the growth rate of China's energy demand will fluctuate slightly in 2020.

    "[42 ,0,0,\"It is nowadays a worldwide trend to implement the so-called digital power industry, which implies optimization of the energy resources dissemination and use, based on modern digital technologies and telecommunication systems. Control systems of this kind must take into account clearly inevident trends in changing energy consumption depending on the time of year, time of day, day of the week, etc. Since the end user is a specific person with his own individual preferences, the task of modeling his behavior in terms of energy consumption is an estimate of some realization of a random process. This process features a quasi-deterministic component and a pronounced random component. The goal of almost all digital power systems is to predict the trends in the quasi-deterministic component, the random component in this case is noise interference. The most appropriate solution when constructing a predictive system is to conduct a digital experiment on an array of data taken during the actual operation of a particular energy consumption accounting system. The research was conducted on a real array of data from energy consumption by 61 households over a period of 730 days. Classical regression analysis methods were compared with neural network analysis (trained with teacher). © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.\"],\n",

Based on the 2003-2015 Shandong Province transportation energy consumption data, this paper uses the top-down method to calculate the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province.On this basis, the grey relational degree analysis method is used to study the impact of seven factors, namely per capita GDP, total population, energy consumption per unit GDP, private car ownership, tourism income, freight turnover and passenger turnover, on the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province. According to the analysis results, the above influencing factors are closely related to the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province. The impact degree is from large to small: passenger turnover > freight turnover > per capita GDP > total population > energy consumption per unit > tourism income> private car ownership. At the same time, using the gray prediction GM(1,1) model to predict the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province from 2016 to 2021, it is concluded that the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province will continue to grow in the next few years. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

    "[47 ,0,0,\"Selecting an appropriate input vector is a critical issue in forecasting. For predicting the daily energy consumption of multiproduct pipelines, the input vector design is usually based on engineering experience, and the number of the traditional input variables is large. However, such a forecast model based on the traditional input variables needs more computational resources and longer training time. In order to prune the number of input variables, the correlation coefficient and partial correlation coefficient are introduced to measure the correlation between input variables and the output variable. In a case study involving a Chinese products pipeline, a new input vector, which contains 5 input variables, are identified from the traditional 15 input variables through the correlation analysis. To verify the rationality of the new vector, an ANN model based on the new vector is developed to forecast the daily energy consumption, and its forecasted values are compared to the values of the ANN model based on the traditional input vector and actual values. The results show that the ANN model based on the new vector has higher prediction accuracy, indicating that more parsimonious set of input variables can be used in daily energy consumption forecast of products pipeline without sacrificing the accuracy of the forecast.\"],\n",

    "[53 ,0,0,\"The use of base station (BS) sleep modes is one of the most studied approaches for the reduction of the energy consumption of radio access networks (RANs). Many papers have shown that the potential energy saving of sleep modes is huge, provided the future behavior of the RAN traffic load is known. This paper investigates the effectiveness of sleep modes combined with machine learning (ML) approaches for traffic forecast. A portion of a RAN is considered, comprising one macro BS and a few small cell BSs. Each BS is powered by a photovoltaic (PV) panel, equipped with energy storage units, and a connection to the power grid. The PV panel and battery provide green energy, while the power grid provides brown energy. Our study examines the impacts of different prediction models on the consumed energy mix and on QoS. Numerical results show that the considered ML algorithms succeed in achieving effective trade-offs between energy consumption and QoS. Results also show that energy savings strongly depend on traffic patterns that are typical of the considered area. This implies that a widespread implementation of these energy saving strategies without the support of ML would require a careful tuning that cannot be performed autonomously and that needs continuous updates to follow traffic pattern variations. On the contrary, ML approaches provide a versatile framework for the implementation of the desired trade-off that naturally adapts the network operation to the traffic characteristics typical of each area and to its evolution.

The elasticity coefficient method is used to forecast China's total energy consumption demand in 2025.The concept of Incremental Contribution Value of Sub-energy (ICVS, i.e. contribution value of sub-energy consumption increment to elasticity coefficient) and its formula are put forward to predict the consumption demand of coal, oil, gas and non-fossil energy in 2025.It shows that China's economic development can be divided into three stages during the period between the years of 2000 and 2018, which includes scale-speed period, medium-to-high-speed growth period and quality-efficiency period. Total consumption of energy can be divided into three stages: extensive development of energy intensive heavy industry, transition from extensive development to high quality development, and new normal high quality development. The elasticity coefficient of energy consumption and contribution value of sub-energy consumption increment also show three stages. According to the study, the demand of China's energy consumption in 2025 will be 5.5 to 5.6 billion tons of coal equivalent, among which, coal, petroleum, natural gas and non-fossil energy consumption demand are 2.8-2.9 billion tons of coal equivalent, 1.1 billion tons of coal equivalent, 0.6 billion tons of coal equivalent and 1.0 billion tons of coal equivalent, accounting for 50%-52%, 20%, 11% and 18% of total energy consumption respectively.

In order to increase the prediction accuracy, based on previous research achievement, the variables that frequently occur in the prediction of natural gas demand as the main influential factors, including GDP, industrial structure, population development, urbanization rate and consumption level were considered. The relative gray correlation degree was adopted to characterize the importance of different factors, and the stepwise regression method was used to finely detect the significance of each factor. The factors with both importance and significance were included in the stepwise-regression double logarithmic demand function model. And a new 'optimal' forecasting model with 'minimum' interpretation variables was constructed by removing the nonsignificant influential factors gradually and selecting the more important influential factors. It was applied to predict the natural gas demand in Sichuan-Chongqing area.\"],\n",

To verify the patterns of electricity energy and water consumption in relation with apartment buildings, we collect data for one of the apartment complexes in South Korea. Both weather history data including temperature and relative humidity and building information such as floor number and the gross area of apartment units are selected as Building-Information Factors (BIF) to analyze their effects on energy use in apartment buildings. In this paper, we cover annual electricity energy and water consumption among major household utilities that is manipulated by BIF. We conduct Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and use neural network-based model such as Multiple-Layer Perceptron (MLP) not only to reveal the relation among the elements such as weather information and BIF toward energy and water consumption model but also to estimate electricity energy and water use forecast. By carrying out this research, the relationship among BIF and energy consumption data sets is turned out to be essential information for establishing a Korean Style Apartment Management Information System as well as establishing a real estate policy on housing prices according to the diversification in floor numbers and gross areas of apartment units. © 2012 ICROS.\"],\n",

The relationship between economic and population growth trend and total customers as well as the demands of contract electricity energy growth trend could be connected by the linear regression method to predict electricity energy consumptions. Through a Simple Econometric Simulation System (SIMPLE-E) program run in Microsoft Excel application, linear regression trend can be calculated.

Nigeria ranks the second in gas flaring and shows low volumes of domestic gas utilization, consuming only about 11% out of the 8.25 billion cubic feet produced per day in 2014 despite its natural gas resource endowment. This paper examines the determinants of domestic utilization of natural gas in Nigeria from 1990-2013. It investigates its relationship as a function of price of natural gas, price of alternative fuels, foreign direct investment, volumes of gas flared, electricity generated from natural gas sources and per capital real GDP. Going further, it forecasts its likely growth rate for a short-term period, using an econometric methodology of ordinary least squares and an ARIMA model, it estimates the relationship between the variables and uses the historical trend to forecast into the future. The result of the study showed that the determinants jointly explain the pattern of domestic gas utilization in Nigeria by 98%. Individually, per capital real GDP, electricity generated from natural gas sources and changes in the volume of domestic utilization of natural gas was found to have a positive and significant effect on domestic gas utilization. Further, the forecast values show evidence of a slow but gradual increase in utilization pattern in the near future from 2015-2020. A best-case scenario of an increase of 0.15% and a worst-case scenario of a decrease of 0.14% was presented. In conclusion, having identified significant influences on domestic gas utilization patterns in Nigeria it is imperative that the government uses economic instrument to enhance the utilization patterns in Nigeria by improving economic activities and developing the power sector which shows significant influence in domestic natural gas utilization patterns.\"],\n",

The paper suggests a method for predicting energy consumption based on statistical data for previous years and regime factors-the number of working days per year, the number of working personnel, climatic factors. Methods are proposed for dividing the total consumption of thermal energy into energy consumption for heating and hot water preparation, as well as the total consumption of electrical energy for heating and the cost of operating equipment and household needs.

The internal relevance between the selected three factors and the regional natural gas consumption was analyzed. The grey model GM(1, N) with fractional order accumulation was established to predict the future demand of natural gas consumption in the eastern, central, and western areas of China based on the selected three factors. Energy consumption structure, GDP, and urbanization rate were three main influencing factors of natural gas consumption in the eastern and central areas, while in the western area, the three main factors are urbanization rate, industry structure and population density. In terms of planning natural gas consumption policies, adjustment of energy consumption structure should be strengthened in the eastern area, relationship between economic development and energy consumption should be focused on in the central area, urbanization should be speeded up in the western area.

Therefore, this paper proposed a prediction method combining curve fitting and GA optimized BP neural network to predict LDG short-term production trend. Specifically, proposed method firstly utilized SVD decomposition to preprocess instantaneous values of LDG production in order to extract a standard type of LDG production during a smelting cycle. Then the standard type was curve fitted to attain function formulas of the overall recovery about time series and meanwhile a series of function clusters and values were procured. Afterwards, GA optimized BP neural network was employed to train parameters of function clusters and thus a recovery trend of LDG during a production period was obtained, which was also called the prediction of short-time production trend. Finally, the actual data from a certain steel and iron enterprise was adopted to verify feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, the results showed that proposed method had a good performance in predicting short-term LDG generation trend.

Here we assess the accuracy of projections of US energy consumption produced by the Energy Information Administration over the period 1982-2000. We find that energy consumption projections have tended to underestimate future consumption. Projections 10-13 years into the future have had an average error of about 4%, and about half that for shorter time horizons. These errors mask much larger, offsetting errors in the projection of GDP and energy intensity (EI). GDP projections have consistently been too high, and EI projection consistently too low, by more than 15% for projections of 10 years or more.

For utility companies, it is important to reliably forecast the aggregate consumption profile to determine energy supply for the next day and prevent any crisis.

The first method is most efficient for a very short-term prediction, such as the prediction period of one hour, and uses a simple adaptive time-series model. For a longer-term prediction, a nonparametric Gaussian process has been applied to forecast the load profiles and their uncertainty bounds to predict a day-ahead. These methods are computationally simple and adaptive and thus suitable for analyzing a large set of data whose pattern changes over the time. These forecasting methods are applied to several sets of building energy consumption data for lighting and heating-ventilation- air-conditioning (HVAC) systems collected from a campus building at Stanford University.

Coal consumption by the electric power sector, which makes up about 92 percent of total coal consumption, has decreased 1.1 percent in 2006, and the electric power sector coal consumption is expected to grow by 0.5 percent in 2007 and 2.1 percent in 2008.\"],\n",
    "[187,0,0,\"The developing world with three-fourths of the world's population consumes less than one-quarter of the world's commercial energy. As these countries grows and develop they will consume a larger share of the world's commercial energy. The goal of this article is to estimate the changes in the developing world's energy consumption in the coming decades. We use all available econometric estimates of income and price elasticities and other historical trends for income, population, and price growth to forecast developing world energy consumption for the next thirty years. Although we find large uncertainties over the forecasts, most scenarios suggest that energy demand in the developing world will increase over 5.5% per year and that global energy consumption can be expected to more than triple in the coming three decades.\"],\n",
    "[188,0,0,\"Greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels lead to erratic climatic change, and creates severe environmental problem worldwide. GHG emissions from diverse sources have harmful effects on the quality of air, water, soil and living organisms. Carbon-di-oxide (CO2) is one among the GHG which plays a major role in polluting the air, hence the estimation and forecasting of CO2 emission has become essential for energy planning and ecological strategy decisions. The objective of this research work is to estimate and forecast CO2 emission in India from various sources of energy consumption. Multiple linear Regression model and PSO algorithm based on nonlinear model were used for CO2 emission estimation. The obtained results have shown that India's CO2 emission has alarmingly increased over the past decade. The results reveal that PSO model could obtain a highly accurate estimation compared to MLR model. From the outcome of PSO estimation, the future projection of CO2 emission in India was carried out for the years from 2017 to 2030 using artificial neural network. The prediction results also emphasize that necessary steps must be taken straight away to reduce CO2 emission across the country, as its impulsive increase in India poses extreme threat to nature and environment. © 2018 The Authors.

    "[189,0,0,\"A recurrent neural network with dynamic characteristic is proposed to forecast the gas holder level and to solve the gas holder prediction problems in iron and steel enterprises. The gas holder is not only concerned with the input gas production and consumption, but also related to the previous gasholder level and dynamics of gas pipe network, thus we adopted Elman neural network with dynamic behavior and added the feedback connection between the output layer and the input layer. In this paper, Elman neural network is improved to adapt the practical mechanism of the gas holder. In addition, the traditional cycle learning method is replaced by the incremental learning method to train samples so as to enhance the learning ability of the model and achieve the results of dynamic modeling and forecast. The validation experiment proved that the method is suitable for forecasting gasholder level. Copyright © 2014 Binary Information Press.\"],\n",
    "[190,0,0,\"Technological progress in the manufacturing sector is characterized by an increase in energy consumption and, consequently, an increase in electricity consumption. It’s necessary to carry out electricities economical consumption to meet the growing demand for electricity. The problem of forecasting of energy consumption is a complex multi-factor problem with nonlinear dependencies. Due to the complexity of the calculations for the solution of this problem requires large computational resources. Therefore there is a need of optimization algorithms to improve the quality of the forecast. This article describes the use of parallel computing on the GPU algorithm neural network training based on CUDA technology, to optimize the energy consumption prediction process in an industrial plant. According to the results of the experiments presented in this paper, the parallel algorithm has reached the required prediction accuracy for a shorter period of time.

    "[191,0,0,\"Short-term electricity consumption data reflects the operating efficiency of grid companies, and accurate forecasting of electricity consumption helps to achieve refined electricity consumption planning and improve transmission and distribution transportation efficiency. In view of the fact that the power consumption data is nonstationary, nonlinear, and greatly influenced by the season, holidays, and other factors, this paper adopts a time-series prediction model based on the EMD-Fbprophet-LSTM method to make short-term power consumption prediction for an enterprise's daily power consumption data. The EMD model was used to decompose the time series into a multisong intrinsic mode function (IMF) and a residual component, and then the Fbprophet method was used to predict the IMF component. The LSTM model is used to predict the short-term electricity consumption, and finally the prediction value of the combined model is measured based on the weights of the single Fbprophet and LSTM models. Compared with the single time-series prediction model, the time-series prediction model based on the EMD-Fbprophet-LSTM method has higher prediction accuracy and can effectively improve the accuracy of short-term regional electricity consumption prediction. © 2021 Guorong Zhu et al.\"],\n",

    "[195,0,0,\"As China's most important energy source, coal plays an important role in the process of economic development and social progress. Accurate prediction of future coal demand for energy strategy development and coal investment and production is of great significance. In order to predict the demand of coal energy in China, this paper uses a hybrid optimization method, which is called BAG-SA based on simulated annealing Gaussian disturbance. This method not only inherits the efficiency of standard bat algorithm, but also strengthen the local search capabilities and global optimization abilities. In this paper, we use the panel data of China coal consumption during 1986 to 2015 as observed data, and take the six factors of economic growth(GDP), total fixed assets investment, total population, per capita living coal consumption, the proportion of coal consumption in energy consumption, Energy processing conversion rate as the input factors. The BAG-SA model is uesd to optimize and obtain the coefficient of the coal demand estimation model in the linear form, the exponential form and quadratic form. The result shows that the prediction values product based on BAG-SA model and the selected influencing factors are very close to the observed values. By comparing the fitting degree of the three models and the prediction of errors, the quadratic equation model is used to forecast the coal demand in China from 2016 to 2030 in three different situations. © 2017 Aussino Academic Publishing House (AAPH).

    "[196,0,0,\"The prediction accuracy of electric power consumption plays a crucial role for the efficiency of a smart grid. Hybrid approaches that jointly account for the linear and nonlinear portions of the electric load have shown promising performance because of the mixture of memory effects and random environmental perturbations. Especially for day-ahead short-term prediction, the potentially long time gap between the measurements and prediction point degrades the linear prediction performance, while the nonlinear prediction based on the weather forecast may supplement the degradation. This paper proposes a residue-based hybrid model that uses linear prediction by auto-regressive modeling and nonlinear prediction by Gaussian process regression with atypical residue of the weather forecast, particularly the difference of weather station forecasted and linear predicted local temperatures. Since the typical memory effect of the temperature can be double counted by both models, atypical residue without its linear prediction contribution is employed for the Gaussian process regression step. To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, a GIST campus electric power consumption dataset is evaluated. As expected, the linear prediction residue shows larger correlation to the atypical residue of temperature than the temperature itself. Consequently, hybrid model with the atypical residue temperature based Gaussian process regression shows improved performance in the day ahead load prediction. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.\"],\n",

    "[198,0,0,\"Consumption of clean energy has been increasing in China. Forecasting gas consumption is important to adjusting the energy consumption structure in the future. Based on historical data of gas consumption from 1980 to 2017, this paper presents a weight method of the inverse deviation of fitted value, and a combined forecast based on a residual auto-regression model and Kalman filtering algorithm is used to forecast gas consumption. Our results show that: (1) The combination forecast is of higher precision: the relative errors of the residual auto-regressive model, the Kalman filtering algorithm and the combination model are within the range (–0.08, 0.09), (–0.09, 0.32) and (–0.03, 0.11), respectively. (2) The combination forecast is of greater stability: the variance of relative error of the residual auto-regressive model, the Kalman filtering algorithm and the combination model are 0.002, 0.007 and 0.001, respectively. (3) Provided that other conditions are invariant, the predicted value of gas consumption in 2018 is 241.81×109 m3. Compared to other time-series forecasting methods, this combined model is less restrictive, performs well and the result is more credible. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

    "[200,0,0,\"The article highlights the main trends in the development of world energy. The method of forecasting energy consumption is presented, taking into account the level and dynamics of energy consumption in general, as well as the use of individual energy resources with differentiation by countries and regions. In the present study, when forming the energy forecast, the key indicators determining the global energy demand are the dynamics of the energy intensity of GDP and per capita energy consumption. It is shown that in the total volume of world consumption of primary energy resources, oil will continue to occupy a leading position. Among fossil fuels, the demand for natural gas will increase most intensively. The share of coal in the structure of consumption of primary energy carriers will decrease, which is associated with the replacement of coal with natural gas in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The greatest growth rates of demand among non-fossil fuels will be observed in renewable energy sources. The main growth in atomic energy consumption will be in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific Region. © 2019\"]\n",
